	* Fixed bug with missing TZ value in graphdefang.cgi.

	  by 10x!!!  This defect and fix was reported by 
	  PRECIGOUT Raphael <raphael.precigout@axa-re.com>.

2003-06-22	John Kirkland <jpk@bl.org>

	* Release 0.9-beta2
	* Added support for setting timezones in the mimedefang-config
	  file.  This is useful if you have 2 different hosts logging

	  zones.

	* Changed $DATAFILE[0] to $DATAFILES[0] in mimedefang-config-

	* added host-based max time tracking
	* added ability to load logs from more than one datafile
	* fixed bug with deferred mail sendmail/sympa event. It was

	  count was higher than it should have been.
	* fixed bug in month handling when we have 31 days in the
	  current month and the first month on our monthly graph
	  has fewer than 31 days.

	  max time data and load graphs anyway (courtesy
          of Brent J. Nordquist <b-nordquist@bethel.edu>).

	* index.php now works with register_globals off
          (courtesy of Brent J. Nordquist <b-nordquist@bethel.edu>

	* Backup SummaryDB.db file before writing to it.

2003-01-06	John Kirkland <jpk@bl.org>

2003-01-02	John Kirkland <jpk@bl.org>
