TODO 

* Add #@PERL@ instead of a hardcode perl binary to scripts and change install
  files to rename xyz.pl.in to xyz.pl installing everything in the correct places

* Figure out how to graph imap and pop3 separately when using dovecot - I believe 
  event/dovecot/general just needs a sub that looks for both imap and pop3 lines 
  (DONE)

* Add filtering so you can look at spam and virus patterns only for a certain domain.
  I'm interested in this because I host several domains with my sendmail install.
  (DONE)

* Add recipientdomain as an accumulator type so I can look at spam and virus totals
  by domain on a single chart.

* Add pie charts and histograms

* Add data caching so we don't need to recalculate summary values that we've already seen.
  (DONE)

* Add more generalized sendmail send and receive stats to the graphs so we know
  the significance of given spam counts.
