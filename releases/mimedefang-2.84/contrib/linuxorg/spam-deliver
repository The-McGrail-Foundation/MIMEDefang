# Description : A list of regex expressions to match against the recipient
#               of the current message.  It is used by the mimedefang filter
#               to determine if a message declared to be SPAM/UCE by the
#               SpamAssassin should be delivered rather than discarded.

# A couple of addresses that really should not have their mail thrown
# away.  It could be someone complaining that they got spam from this
# domain or a machine serving this domain.  The down side of this is 
# that abuse@ and postmaster@ will receive undesirable spam messages.  
# Not the best solution but losing valid complaints isn't tolerable 
# in the least.
