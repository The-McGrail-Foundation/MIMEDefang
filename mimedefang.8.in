.SH NAME
mimedefang \- Sendmail MIME mail filter
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mimedefang prcap

.B mimedefang \fR-p \fIconnection\fR -m \fImx_socket_name\fR -U \fIuser\fR [\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmimedefang\fR is a filter built around Sendmail 8.11's \fImilter\fR
API for mail filters.  It collects each incoming message and runs
a filter on the message.  This is useful for deleting attachments
which may be a security risk on poorly-designed systems like Microsoft
Windows.

\fBmimedefang\fR does not actually run the Perl filter; instead, it
communicates with \fBmimedefang-multiplexor\fR(8), which manages a
pool of persistent Perl processes.  See the \fBmimedefang-multiplexor\fR
man page for additional information.

.SH OPTIONS

If you invoke \fBmimedefang\fR with the single argument
\fBprcap\fR, it prints information about the version of Milter
it is linked against and exits.  Otherwise, you should invoke
\fBmimedefang\fR as shown in the second line of the SYNOPSIS.

.TP
.B \-U \fIuser\fR
Runs \fBmimedefang\fR as \fIuser\fR rather than \fIroot\fR.  The
\fIuser\fR argument must match the argument to
\fBmimedefang-multiplexor\fR's \fB\-U\fR option as well.

.TP
.B \-y
If the \fB\-y\fR command-line option is given, MIMEDefang will
call smfi_setsymlist to set the list of macros it wants.  \fIThis function
leaked memory in versions of Sendmail prior to 8.14.4\fR so by default
we do not call it.  If you are running an older version of sendmail,
you should explicitly set the list of macros you want in the Sendmail
configuration file.

.TP
.B \-z \fIspooldir\fR
Set the spool directory to \fIspooldir\fR.  If this option is omitted,
the spool directory defaults to @SPOOLDIR@.

.TP
.B \-p \fIconnection\fR
The \fB\-p\fR switch is required and specifies the \fImilter\fR connection
type.  Typically, you should run \fBmimedefang\fR on the same computer
as \fBsendmail\fR.  Therefore, you should use a UNIX-domain socket for
the connection type.  The suggested value for the \fB\-p\fR switch is
\fBmimedefang.sock\fR under the spool directory.

.TP
.B \-m \fImx_socket_name\fR
Specifies the socket for communicating with
\fBmimedefang-multiplexor\fR(8).  The \fImx_socket_name\fR specifies
the path of the UNIX-domain socket.  See
\fBmimedefang-multiplexor\fR(8) for details.

.TP
.B \-b \fIbacklog\fR
Sets the "backlog" argument to the \fBlisten\fR(2) system call
to \fIbacklog\fR.  If this option is omitted, then the operating-system
default backlog is used.

.TP
\fB\-G\fR
Normally, \fBmimedefang\fR uses a umask of 077 when creating the
milter socket and files.  If you would like the socket to be readable
and writeable by the group and files to be group-readable, supply the
\fB\-G\fR option.  This causes the umask to be 007 whenever
UNIX-domain sockets are created and 027 whenever files are created.
\fINote\fR: if your milter library is too old to have the
smfi_opensocket() function, the \fB\-G\fR option causes
\fBmimedefang\fR to use a umask of 007 throughout its execution.

Note that by default, @SPOOLDIR@ is created with mode 0700.
If you use the \fB\-G\fR option, you probably should change
the mode to 0750.

.TP
.B \-d
The \fB\-d\fR switch causes \fBmimedefang\fR \fInot\fR to delete
the temporary spool files it creates for incoming messages.  This is
for debugging purposes only and should \fInever\fR be used on a
production mail server.

.TP
.B \-r
Causes \fBmimedefang\fR to perform a relay check before processing
any messages.  It calls into a user-supplied Perl function
called \fBfilter_relay\fR with the IP address and host name of the
sending relay.  (See \fBmimedefang-filter\fR(5) for details.)

.TP
.B \-H
Causes \fBmimedefang\fR to perform a HELO check before processing any
messages.  It calls into a user-supplied Perl function called
\fBfilter_helo\fR with the IP address and host name of the sending
relay, and the HELO argument.  (See \fBmimedefang-filter\fR(5) for
details.)


.TP
.B \-s
Causes \fBmimedefang\fR to perform a sender check before processing
the message body.  It calls into a user-supplied Perl function
called \fBfilter_sender\fR with the envelope address of the sender.
(See \fBmimedefang-filter\fR(5) for details.)

.TP
.B \-t
Causes \fBmimedefang\fR to perform recipient checks before processing
the message body.  It calls into a user-supplied Perl function
called \fBfilter_recipient\fR with the envelope address of each recipient.
(See \fBmimedefang-filter\fR(5) for details.)

.TP
.B \-q
Permits the multiplexor to queue new connections.  See the section
QUEUEING REQUESTS in the mimedefang-multiplexor man page.  Note that
this option and the \fB\-R\fR option are mutually-exclusive.  If you
supply \fB\-q\fR, then \fB\-R\fR is ignored.

.TP
.B \-k
Causes \fBmimedefang\fR \fInot\fR to delete working directories if
a filter fails.  This lets you obtain the message which caused the
filter to fail and determine what went wrong.  \fBmimedefang\fR logs
the directory containing the failed message using syslog.

.TP
.B \-P \fIfileName\fR
Causes \fBmimedefang\fR to write its process-ID (after
becoming a daemon) to the specified file.  The file will be
owned by root.

.TP
.B \-o \fIfileName\fR
Causes \fbmimedefang\fR to use \fIfileName\fR as a lock file to avoid
multiple instances from running.  If you supply \fB\-P\fR but not
\fB\-o\fR, then \fbmimedefang\fR constructs a lock file by appending
".lock" to the pid file.  However, this is less secure than having a
root-owned pid file in a root-owned directory and a lock file writable
by the user named by the \fB\-U\fR option.  (The lock file must be
writable by the \fB\-U\fR user.)

.TP
.B \-R \fInum\fR
Normally, \fBmimedefang\fR tempfails a new SMTP connection if
there are no free workers.  Supplying the \fB\-R\fR \fInum\fR option
makes \fBmimedefang\fR tempfail new connections if there are fewer
than \fInum\fR free workers, \fIunless\fR the connection is from the
local host.  This allows you to favour connections from localhost so
your clientmqueue doesn't build up.  Note that supplying \fB\-R 0\fR
is subtly different from omitting the option; in this case, \fBmimedefang\fR
permits new connections from localhost to queue, but not connections
from other hosts (unless you also supply the \fB\-q\fR option.)

The purpose of the \fB\-R\fR option is to reserve resources for
clientmqueue runs.  Otherwise, on a very busy mail server, clientmqueue
runs can starve for a long time, leading to delays for locally-generated
or streamed mail.  We recommend using a small number for \fInum\fR;
probably no more than 3 or 10% of the total number of workers (whichever
is smaller.)

Note that this option and the \fB\-q\fR option are mutually-exclusive.
If you supply \fB\-q\fR, then \fB\-R\fR is ignored.

.TP
.B \-C
Conserve file descriptors by opening and closing disk files more
often.  (Disk files are never held open across Milter callbacks.)
While this shortens the length of time a file descriptor is open, it
also leaves more opportunities for the open to fail.  We do not
recommend the use of this flag except on very busy systems that
exhibit failures due to a shortage of file descriptors.

.TP
.B \-T
Causes \fBmimedefang\fR to log the run-time of the Perl filter using
syslog.

.TP
.B \-x \fIstring\fR
Add \fIstring\fR as the content of the X-Scanned-By: header.  If you
set \fIstring\fR to the empty string (i.e. \-x ""), then no X-Scanned-By:
header will be added.

.TP
.B \-X
Do not add an X-Scanned-By: header.  Specifying \-X is equivalent to
specifying \-x "".

.TP
.B \-D
Do not fork into the background and become a daemon.  Instead, stay
in the foreground.  Useful mainly for debugging or if you have a
supervisory process managing \fBmimedefang\fR.

.TP
.B \-M
This option is obsolete; it is accepted for backward-compatibility,
but is ignored.

.TP
.B \-N
Normally, \fBmimedefang\fR sees all envelope recipients, even ones that
Sendmail knows to be invalid.  If you don't want Sendmail to perform
a milter callback for recipients it knows to be invalid, invoke
\fBmimedefang\fR with the \-N flag.  \fIPlease note that this
flag only works with Sendmail and Milter 8.14.0 and newer.  It has
no effect if you're running an older version of Sendmail or Milter.\fR

.TP
\-S \fIfacility\fR
Specifies the syslog facility for log messages.  The default is
\fImail\fR.  See \fBopenlog\fR(3) for a list of valid facilities.
You can use either the short name ("mail") or long name ("LOG_MAIL") for
the facility name.

.TP
\-a \fImacro\fR
Pass the value of the specified Sendmail macro through to the Perl filter.
You can repeat the \-a option to write more macros than the built-in
defaults.  Note that in addition to asking \fBmimedefang\fR to pass the
macro value to the filter, you must configure Sendmail to pass the
macro through to \fBmimedefang\fR using the confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM
definition in Sendmail's m4 configuration file.

.TP
.B \-c
Strip "bare" carriage-returns (CR) characters from the message body.
A bare CR should never appear in an e-mail message.  Older versions
of \fBmimedefang\fR used to strip them out automatically, but now they
are left in by default.  The \fB\-c\fR option enables the older behavior.
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information and exit.

.SH OPERATION

When \fBmimedefang\fR starts, it connects to \fBsendmail\fR using the
\fImilter\fR API.  (See the Sendmail 8.11 documentation.)  For each
incoming message, \fBmimedefang\fR creates a temporary directory and
saves information in the directory.  At various phases during the SMTP
conversation, \fBmimedefang\fR communicates with \fBmimedefang-multiplexor\fR
to perform various operations.  \fBmimedefang-multiplexor\fR manages a pool
of persistent Perl processes that actually perform the mail scanning
operations.

.PP
When a Perl process scans an e-mail, the temporary spool directory
contains certain files; details of the communication protocol between
\fBmimedefang\fR and the Perl script are in
\fBmimedefang-protocol\fR(7).

.SH WARNINGS
\fBmimedefang\fR does violence to the flow of e-mail.  The Perl filter
is quite picky and assumes that MIME e-mail messages are well-formed.
While I have tried to make the script safe, I take \fIno responsibility\fR
for lost or mangled e-mail messages or any security holes this script
may introduce.
