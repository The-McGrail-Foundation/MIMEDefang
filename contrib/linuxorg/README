The files in this directory are installed in /etc/mail/mimedefang/ on 
mail servers within the Linux Online and Linux Headquarters domains.  
They are used to filter viruses and SPAM/UCE mail from being received
by our staff & users.

In order to use the filter in the above directory, either the 
/etc/sysconfig/mimedefang file needs to be edited to:

   SUBFILTER=/etc/mail/mimedefang/filter

or a symlink needs to be made from /etc/mail/mimedefang-filter to 
/etc/mail/mimedefang/filter.  

The contents of each file are described within the header of the file.
Please read those files to determine what they contain.

Any questions or comments about the files in this directory should be
sent to Michael McLagan <Michael.McLagan@linux.org>.
