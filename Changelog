	* Obtain the Queue-ID as early as possible in the SMTP
	session. Requires the "-y" command-line option to mimedefang.

	* Add support for USE_SETSYMLIST in the system unit and Red Hat

	option to mimedefang.

2020-11-18 Giovanni Bechis <gbechis@pccc.com>

	* mimedefang.pl: Add support for a configuration file
	to separate data from code

2020-08-19 Giovanni Bechis <g.bechis@snb.it>

2018-03-21 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.84 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl: Correctly use "$mon" rather than "$min" to generate
	quarantine file names.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor: Make "workerinfo nnn" show how long ago
	the last state change was for a given worker.

2017-10-30 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.83 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl: Do not add a Message-ID: header when handing a
	message to SpamAssassin if the original message lacks such a
	header.

	* Add systemd unit files; thanks to Richard Laager.

	* Minor tweaks to the sample filter.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor: Change the maxLifetime option to kick in
	only once a worker has processed at least one request; also check
	for exceeded lifetimes during the periodic idle-time check.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor: Fix an exit(EXIT_FAILURE) to be
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) in on place.

2017-09-08 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.82 RELEASED

	* Update contrib/graphdefang with improvements from Kevin A. McGrail.

	* Fix Red Hat init script (thanks to Robert Scheck)

	* Exit with EXIT_SUCCESS if mimedefang-multiplexor is told to
	terminate.

	* Terminology change:  Change "slave" to "worker" everywhere.

	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	Check your init scripts to make sure they use current names for shell
	variables; a few "SLAVE" strings have been changed to "WORKER"

	* Add a new -V maxLifetime option to mimedefang-multiplexor that
	terminates worker processes after maxLifetime seconds (approximately).
	This is in addition to the -r maxRequests option.

	* Log the lifetime and number of requests processed when we terminate
	a worker process.

2017-08-31 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.81 RELEASED

	* Don't barf if the installed version of Sys::Syslog has a developer
	tag added (like 0.33_01 on Debian Stretch).

	* Make mimedefang and mimedefang-multiplexor write their PID files
	as root to avoid an unprivileged user tampering with the pidfiles.
	Thanks to Michael Orlitzky for pointing this issue out.

	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	You should move your PID files out of the MIMEDefang spool directory
	and into a standard root-owned directory like /var/run.  Use the -o
	option to create lock files in the spool directory.  The sample
	init scripts have been updated to reflect this.

2017-07-24 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.80 RELEASED

	* md-mx-ctrl: Add newline to mimedefang-multiplexor output that lacks
	a newline.

	* mimedefang-util: Properly substitute @PERL@ at configure time.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Move variable declarations to start of
	compound statement to avoid problems with older C compilers.

	* mimedefang.pl: Add an extra level of subdirectories in the quarantine
	to avoid 32K subdirectory limit on ext3.  Idea by Kevin McGrail.

	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***  Quarantine subdirectory naming changed.

	* mimedefang.c: Fix bug that caused Queue-ID not to show up when
	using MIMEDefang with Postfix (thanks to Kris Deugau).

2016-09-26 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.79 RELEASED

	* Add the --data-dump option to scripts/mimedefang-util

	* Improve Postfix compatibility by trying to get QueueID after first
	RCPT command, and if not found, at the EOH milter phase.

	* Make mimedefang-multiplexor exit with a successful return code upon
	receipt of SIGTERM.

	* Use 64-bit variables where supported for some statstics counters that
	could overflow with only 32-bit variables, yielding incorrect statistics.
	* Fix configure.in to correctly detect that an embedded Perl interpreter
	can be destroyed/recreated on systems that need the -pthread GCC flag.

2015-04-23 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.78 RELEASED

	* Fix bug in logic that coalesces multiparts to single-parts if
	  possible; the bug broke DKIM signing.  Fix is courtesy of
	  Peter Nagel.

2015-04-20 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.77 RELEASED

	* Change old author's name to "Dianne Skoll" in many places.

2015-03-27 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.76 RELEASED

2015-03-24 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Get rid of all Perl function prototypes.
	  Perl prototypes are badly-implemented and consensus among
	  modern Perl 5 programmers is they shouldn't be used.
	  https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/perl/DCL00-PL.+Do+not+use+subroutine+prototypes

2015-03-24 Faraz Vahabzadeh <faraz@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Add support for filter_wrapup callback.  This is called at the
	  very end and permits header modifications, but not body
	  modifications.  Useful for DKIM-signing.

2015-03-09 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fix typo: SOPHOS should have been SAVSCAN

2015-01-15 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: Don't add a MIME-Version header if there is already
	  one.

2014-10-03 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Fix https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=646347
	  courtesy of Chrisoph Martin

2014-09-09 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Minor clarifications to mimedefang-filter man page.

2014-06-21 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Add "All / Summary" button to watch-multiple-mimedefangs.tcl

2014-05-21 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.75 RELEASED

	* Many cosmetic improvements to watch-multiple-mimedefangs.tcl

	* Fix md_get_bogus_mx_hosts so it checks A records iff a domain has
	  no MX records.

	* Add a forward declaration of rebuild_entity to avoid warnings on
	  recent Perl versions.

2013-05-27 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.74 RELEASED

2013-05-25 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Increase buffer size for md-mx-ctrl responses.

2013-01-22 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Close input file handle in append_to_html_part.  Bug found by
	Kees Theunissen.

2012-09-17 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Add action_add_entity function.

	* Simplify code in action_replace_with_warning.

2012-06-18 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Remove obsolete text from man page.

	* Avoid deprecated "defined(@array)" construct.

2012-03-27 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Implement new "load1" md-mx-ctrl command which gives statistics
	in more useful format than "load"

	* get_mx_ip_addresses: Treat MX records of '', '.', '0', '0.', '0
	.' and '0 ' as bogus.

	* watch-multiple-mimedefangs.tcl: Major improvements; see the
	new -n, -r, -s and -t command-line options.

2012-02-07 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Add rcpt_addr, rcpt_host and rcpt_mailer to default set of
	macros that we ask for.

	* Log Sendmail queue ID in more places.

	* Remove dead "connect_to_socket" routine in mimedefang.pl

	* Do not invokve smfi_setsymlist unless "-y" option to
	mimedefang is given.  smfi_setsymlist leaks memory in versions
	of Sendmail prior to 8.14.4.

2012-01-23 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.73 RELEASED

2012-01-20 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Create /var/spool/MIMEDefang with mode 0750 by default.

2012-01-18 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Make the -G option cause files created by mimedefang to
	be group-readable.  Add the new MD_ALLOW_GROUP_ACCESS init script
	variable.

2011-12-21 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Make the multiplexor snoop in on communications and save the
	Sendmail queue-ID for logging purposes.  It logs the queue ID when
	logging a worker's STDERR.

2011-12-12 Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Make configure.in check whether or not libmilter requires -lldap.

	* Fix Graphdefang to handle new md_syslog output style.

	* Always check return code from chdir() in mimedefang.pl.  In
	certain cases on large and heavily-loaded servers, if the chdir()
	failed MIMEDefang would end up working in the wrong directory with
	attendant chaos.

	* Add "-G" option to mimedefang and mimedefang-multiplexor.  This
	makes their sockets group-readable and group-writable.

	* Pass along the client port number, server IP address and server port
	number to all filter functions.  This feature was sponsored by Scayl.

2011-07-20  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.72 RELEASED

2011-06-20  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.72-BETA-2

	* The "make unstripped" target has disappeared.  Instead,
	use:  make INSTALL_STRIP_FLAG=''

	* The RPM_INSTALL_ROOT make variable has disappeared.  Instead,
	use the standard DESTDIR:  make install DESTDIR=/some/dir

	* In mimedefang.c, truncate overlong responses from the multiplexor.
	Also sanitize replies so "\r" doesn't get fed to smfi_setmlreply.

	* If a worker process replies with a very long reply, have the
	multiplexor consume (and discard) the excess input so the
	multiplexor-to-worker protocol does not become de-synchronized.

2011-06-16  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* When mimedefang becomes a daemon, have it wait for a
	"go/no-go" message from the child before exiting.  This should
	eliminate race conditions whereby the MTA starts before the
	milter socket is present.

	* Revert change in 2.72-BETA-1 that passed client port number.
	It was a hack; we need a proper way to pass largish amounts of
	information to the filter and that will have to wait for a major
	reworking of MIMEDefang.

2010-11-01  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.72-BETA-1

	* Avoid run-time errors from Unix::Syslog on some platforms.

	* Change md_syslog to log the Sendmail Queue-ID if it is
	available.

	* Pass SMTP client port number to filter_relay, filter_helo,
	filter_sender and filter_recipient.  Also make it available
	to filter_begin/filter/filter_end in $RelayPort global variable.

	* Remove references to ParanoidFiler.

2010-08-18  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.71 RELEASED

	* More spelunking in the awful innards of Perl reveals that our
	original fix in 2.70 for handling of $SIG{FOO}... didn't
	completely fix the problem.  On systems where Perl was compiled to
	use threading, running "md-mx-ctrl reread" could result in
	subsequent failure by scanners to set signal dispositions.  This
	has been fixed.

2010-06-30  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Fix typo in examples/init-script.in

	* Fix compatibility with Postfix (broken in 2.70.)

2010-06-24  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.70 RELEASED

	* Fixed a bug in embedded Perl: We have to call
	PERL_SET_CONTEXT after forking or Perl gets confused.
	In particular, setting signal-handling dispositions using
	$SIG{FOO} = sub { ... } breaks.

2010-06-16  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.69 RELEASED

	* Clarify wording of mimedefang-filter man page.

2010-06-16  Dave O'Neill <dmo@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Remove obsolete code that used to attempt to generate working
	directory names.  Deactivate the no-longer-needed "-M" mimedefang
	option.

	* Makefile.in: "make install" target obeys only DESTDIR and now ignores RPM_INSTALL_ROOT

2010-05-13  Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Add new "-y" option to mimedefang-multiplexor.  This limits
	the number of concurrent "recipok" commands on a per-domain basis.

2010-05-13  Dave O'Neill <dmo@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Remove Anomy::HTMLCleaner support.

	* use MIME::Parser::Filer's ignore_filename() call instead of
	subclassing to override evil_filename().  Same effect, less code.

	* refactor resend_message_one_recipient() to use
	resend_message_specifying_mode() instead of reimplementing it.

	* header_timezone() now generates a strictly RFC2822-compliant timezone
	string without needing POSIX::strftime()

2010-03-02  Dave O'Neill <dmo@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Ensure that decode_mimewords() is called in scalar context.

2010-02-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.68 RELEASED

	* The functions add_recipient, change_sender, delete_recipient,
	action_add_header and action_insert_header can be called from
	outside message context (that is, from filter_sender and
	filter_recipient).  Based on suggestion from D. Stussy.

2010-02-16  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.68-BETA-5

	* Detect Sys::Syslog vs. Unix::Syslog at run-time rather than
	when running ./configure.

	* Fix a crash with embedded Perl on FreeBSD with Perl 5.10.0.
	Problem noted by Martin Blapp.

2010-02-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.68-BETA-4.

	* Bug fix: Don't change Content-Disposition to "inline" by default.
	This was causing weird bugs with Outlook iCalendar attachments:

	http://lists.roaringpenguin.com/pipermail/mimedefang/2006-December/031525.html
	http://lists.roaringpenguin.com/pipermail/mimedefang/2004-November/025461.html

	* Fix a really stupid segmentation fault when handling multiline
	replies.  Bug found and fixed by Michiel Brandenburg.

	* Make relay_is_blacklisted and relay_is_blacklisted_multi handle
	IPv6 addresses.  Patch loosely based on submission by Michiel
	Brandenburg.  NOTE: relay_is_blacklisted_multi and relay_is_blacklisted
	are DEPRECATED.  Use the CPAN module Net::DNSBL::Client instead.

	* Guard the rewriting of IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses to plain IPv4
	with N6_IS_ADDR_V4MAPPED and IN6_IS_ADDR_V4COMPAT tests.

2009-12-30  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.68-BETA-3.

	* Work around File::Spec::Unix's behaviour of caching
	$ENV{TMPDIR}.  (I consider this a bug; see
	https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=53236)

	* Don't add a To: line for SpamAssassin's benefit; adding such
	a line could mask a useful SpamAssassin rule.

2009-12-30  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.68-BETA-2.

	* Try hard not to lose any STDERR messages before reaping a worker.

	* Make the C code call smfi_setmlreply if (1) the milter library
	supports it and (2) the Perl code returns a multi-line reply.

	* Convert an IPv6-mapped IPv4 address to pure IPv4.  That is,
	convert ::ffff:a.b.c.d simply to a.b.c.d.

	* Make rm_r more robust.

	* Set TMPDIR environment variable to $workdir/tmp before
	scanning; this should make Perl temporary files use the ramdisk.

	* Various code cleanups.

	* When creating the Mail::SpamAssassin object, set user_dir
	to /var/spool/MD-Quarantine.  Fixes problems with SpamAssassin
	3.3.0.

2009-03-31  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.68-BETA-1.

	* Make "Overlong line in RESULTS file" a permanent, rather than
	temporary, failure.

	* Eliminate a possible race condition in SIGTERM handling.  On
	busy, underpowered servers, this could result in the multiplexor
	spontaneously terminating all workers and unlinking its socket.

	* Check for both POLLIN and POLLHUP if we use poll()

	* Fix bug in closing of file descriptors after forking; we'd
	sometimes close our status descriptor by mistake.

	* Remove some pointless fcntl() calls.

	* Fix bug with Perl 5.10 and embedded perl, mentioned at
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=516913
	NOTE: This is a bug in Perl, not MIMEDefang, but we need to work
	around it.

	* Consume and log any STDERR output even if worker has terminated.

2009-01-06  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.67 RELEASED

	* Added support for FPROTD version 6 daemonized scanner.

2008-10-31  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.66 RELEASED

	* Added the option to use poll(2) instead of select(2) in
	mimedefang-multiplexor.  Use the --enable-poll ./configure option.
	This will eliminate problems with file descriptors > 1023 on
	many systems.  Thanks to Concordia University for sponsoring this
	development.

2008-02-02  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.65 RELEASED

	* Fix a few minor compiler warnings

2008-08-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.65-BETA-1 RELEASED

	* embperl.c, configure.in: Fix problems with embedded Perl on
	Debian HPPA architecture.

	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=486069

2008-01-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.64 RELEASED

	* Fix typo in the generic init-script.in file.  Also, on
	FreeBSD/NetBSD, generic init-script.in fits into the *BSD init
	structure natively.

	* watch-multiple-mimedefangs.tcl: Works better with Tcl/Tk 8.5.
	Displays message volumes/day in more human-readable form.  New
	-archive option logs statistics to files.

2007-09-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.64-BETA-1 RELEASED

	* Add support for NOD32 command-line scanner (Dusan Zovinec)

	* Add support for Sophos "savscan" scanner (Adam Lanier)

	* embperl.c: Fix Perl's $$ variable so it reflects the actual PID
	of the worker process.  If you are using Embedded Perl, this should
	remove a major source of irritation (log messages previously used
	the PID of the master multiplexor process.)

2007-09-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  mimedefang.pl.in: Make md_check_against_smtp_server include the
	Sendmail Queue-ID in the syslog message.

	* mimedefang.c: If mail is submitted via a UNIX-domain socket
	(yes, this is possible, apparently!) consider the sending relay
	to be 127.0.0.1.  Fixes Debian bug #439432

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Minor clarifications

	* redhat/mimedefang-init.in: Minor fixes

	* examples/init-script.in: Minor fixes

2007-08-13  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.63 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Relax the umask when creating the
	unprivileged socket ("-a" command-line option.)

	*  mimedefang.c(eom): If we do not have a queue ID yet, try to
	obtain one in eom.  This is designed to improve operation with
	Postfix, which does not assign a queue ID until after the first
	successful RCPT.  Based on a patch from Henrik Krohns.

	*  examples/init-script.in: Added MD_SKIP_BAD_RCPTS init
	script option (suggested by John Nemeth)

	* Remove support for OpenAntivirus.  It's a dead product.

	* mimedefang.pl.in(spam_assassin_status): Call $mail->finish()
	to prevent temporary files from accumulating.

	* redhat/mimedefang-init.in: Add configtest routine to check filter
	syntax.

2007-04-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.62 RELEASED

	* milter_cap.c: Minor code cleanups.

2007-03-30  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.62-BETA-1

	* You can invoke mimedefang like this:   mimedefang prcap
	and it prints details about the version of libmilter it's linked
	with and exit.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: A new "change_sender" action lets you change
	the envelope sender.  Only works with Sendmail/Milter 8.14.0 and
	newer!

	* mimedefang.c: A new "-N" flag causes Sendmail not to make
	filter_recipient callbacks for invalid recipients.  Only works
	with Sendmail/Milter 8.14.0!  Note that without the -N flag,
	MIMEDefang now works the same with 8.14.0 and 8.13.x -- you always
	see all recipients by default, even invalid ones.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Clam interface code has been fixed to work
	properly with ClamAV 0.90 and later.

	* redhat/mimedefang-init.in: Understand MX_TICK_REQUEST and
	MX_TICK_PARALLEL variables which get translated into -X and -P
	mimedefang-multiplexor options, respectively.

2007-02-09  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.61 RELEASED

	* SECURITY FIX: Versions 2.59 and 2.60 contained a programming
	error that could lead to a buffer overflow.  This is definitely
	exploitable as a denial-of-service attack, and potentially may
	allow arbitrary code execution.  The bug is fixed in 2.61.

	* mimedefang.c: If a message is going to end up being rejected,
	discarded or tempfailed, we don't bother carrying out requests
	to add/delete/modify headers or recipients, change the message
	body, etc.

2007-02-02  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.60 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.c: Fix filter registration so MIMEDefang works
	correctly against libmilter from Sendmail 8.14

	* Fix a number of "pointer differs in signedness" warnings.
	(Problem noted by Ashley Kirchner.)

2007-01-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.59 RELEASED

	* watch-multiple-mimedefangs: Add grid-lines; tweak GUI a bit.

2007-01-19  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.59-BETA-3

	* configure.in and Makefile.in: Instead of explicitly linking
	against limilter.a, just supply the -lmilter link option.  This
	means it should work properly on 64-bit systems that keep their
	libraries in /usr/lib64.  It also means that if you have a
	libmilter.so lying around, we'll link against it instead of linking
	statically.

	* configure.in: Require only 0.15 of Sys::Syslog to check for
	setlogsock('native').  (Matt Selsky)

	* mimedefang.c: Major changes: We build up the contents of
	COMMANDS in memory and write it out in one big chunk per milter
	callback.  Not only does this reduce the number of system calls,
	but we also now _check the return code_ of those calls!

	* mimedefang.pl.in(item_contains_virus_fprotd): More careful inspection
	of F-PROT output to determine virus name.  (Jan-Pieter Cornet)

2007-01-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.59-BETA-2

	* Added a new tool (watch-multiple-mimedefangs.tcl) for monitoring
	a cluster of MIMEDefang scanners

	* mimedefang.pl.in: (dmo) Change "use POSIX;" to "use POSIX ();"
	to save several hundred kilobytes of memory per worker.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: (dmo) Remove useless "use Getopt::Std;"

	* mimedefang.pl.in: (dmo) Some code refactoring.

2006-12-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.59-BETA-1

	*  Modify multiplexor and mimedefang.pl.in so worker status updates
	work correctly (the -Z multiplexor flag.)  Previously, the worker
	status wasn't being reset correctly.

	*  Modify multiplexor so worker status changes are broadcast using
	the notification facility (-O multiplexor flag).  A new "S" message
	is used for worker status changes.

	*  mimedefang.pl.in(read_commands_file): If the COMMANDS file did not
	end with an F, the worker would give up and become idle, but not
	inform the multiplexor.  As a result, the multiplexor would think
	the worker was busy, and the worker would be unavailable until the
	busy timeout elapsed and it was killed by the multiplexor.  This
	bug has been fixed.

	*  redhat/mimedefang-spec.in: Changes as suggested by Philip
	Prindeville for cleaning up RPM builds and detecting proper
	libraries on x86-64 systems.

2006-11-07  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  VERSION 2.58 RELEASED

	* Memory leak in mimedefang found and fixed.  If a client issues
	more than one MAIL command in a single SMTP session, then the
	milter used to leak approximately 16 bytes for each subsequent
	MAIL command.

	*  Running ./configure --enable-debugging includes much more debugging
	output, especially to diagnose memory allocation and deallocation.
	DO NOT USE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER.

	*  If we have Sys::Syslog 0.16 or higher, do not call setlogsock
	(which is deprecated).  Patch based on suggestion from Matt Selsky.

	*  Sample init script sets HOME=/var/spool/MIMEDefang.

	*  Sample filter for Windows clients tweaked slightly: We don't
	complain about non-multipart .eml attachments (was causing false
	positives.)

	*  Fixed typo in Red Hat sample init script.

2006-10-19  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.58-BETA-1 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl.in: If SpamAssassin version >= 3.1.5, do not
	supply LOCAL_RULES_DIR or LOCAL_STATE_DIR in constructor.  Use
	defaults from Perl modules.

	*  examples/init-script.in: Add ALLOW_NEW_CONNECTIONS_TO_QUEUE
	config variable.

	*  mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Fix useless call to sigprocmask.
	(Used SIG_BLOCK; should have been SIG_SETMASK)

	*  mimedefang.c: Make sure that we're given the -p option.

	*  embperl.c: Remove warning about "Something in your filter has
	opened a file descriptor..." because there are way too many systems
	that trigger this warning, and they don't seem to have problems.

2006-07-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  Remove all support for the File::Scan module.

2006-06-19  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  VERSION 2.57 RELEASED

	* suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Explicitly set
	$entity variable in filter_begin.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: If clamdscan fails with zip module failure,
	attempt to use scanner in $Features{'Virus:CLAMAV'} rather than
	a hard-coded call to "clamscan"

2006-05-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  VERSION 2.57-BETA-1 RELEASED

	* Minor fixes to man pages.  Some cleanups courtesy of
	Brandon Hutchinson

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: New "md-mx-ctrl hload" command keeps track
	of load for past 1, 4, 12 and 24 hours.  Gives long-term data to
	complement the short-term "md-mx-ctrl load" data.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor: New scheduling algorithm tries to keep
	commands "sticky".  For example, when looking for a worker to run
	"recipok", we prefer to use a worker that recently ran "recipok".
	NOTE!!! If your filter incorrectly retains state from earlier
	callbacks into filter_begin, this scheduling change WILL expose
	the bugs in your filter.

	* mimedefang.c: Bug fix for NULL pointer dereference when running
	"sendmail -bs".  Problem noted by Leena Heino.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fix for FPROTD integration courtesy of
	Jonathan Hankins.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fix for H+BEDV integration courtesy of
	Thorsten Schlichting.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Pass LOCAL_STATE_DIR => '/var/lib' to
	Mail::SpamAssassin constructor.  If your LOCAL_STATE_DIR
	is elsewhere, you'll have to hack the Perl code, I'm afraid.

2006-02-13  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  VERSION 2.56 RELEASED

	* Remove spam_assassin_init()->compile_now(1) call from sample filter.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Fix off-by-one error that could result
	in a worker thinking that the global generation counter had
	changed, causing the worker to restart unnecessarily.

	* redhat/mimedefang-init.in: Add support for MX_HELO_CHECK
	configuration variable.

2006-02-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.56-BETA-1 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.c: Fix compilation problem on some systems.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: entity_contains_virus_nai,
	message_contains_virus_nai: Add the --mime option when invoking
	uvscan.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: message_contains_virus_clamd: Use more reasonable
	timeouts when talking to clamd.


2006-01-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.55 RELEASED

2006-01-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.55-BETA-4 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.c: The new '-R' option lets you reserve a specified
	number of workers for connections from localhost.  The idea is to
	try to allow clientmqueue runs to succeed even on heavily-loaded
	systems.

	* Patched to look for more modern "vascan" virus-scanner rather than
	older "vexira" scanner.  Support for the older Vexira scanner has
	been dropped; please see README.VEXIRA.  Changes courtesy of
	Matt Selsky and Ken Cormack.

2006-01-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.55-BETA-3 RELEASED

2006-01-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Added support for "filter_helo" function, based on a patch from
	Philip Prindeville.

	* examples/init-script.in: Fixed typo.

	* mimedefang.c: Use symbolic constants (MD_TEMPFAIL, MD_CONTINUE,
	etc.) instead of hard-coded integers, based on suggestion from
	Philip Prindeville.

2006-01-11  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.55-BETA-2 RELEASED

	*  mimedefang.pl.in: The filter_begin function is now passed
	a single argument ($entity) representing the parsed message.

	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY *** filter_begin NOW TAKES ONE ARGUMENT,
				     NOT ZERO.  IF YOUR FILTER HAS A
				     PROTOTYPE FOR filter_begin, YOU SHOULD
				     FIX OR REMOVE THE PROTOTYPE

	* mimedefang.c, mimedefang.pl.in: Added new action_insert_header
	to prepend headers (rather than appending them).  Only works
	properly with Sendmail 8.13; on older versions of Sendmail, falls
	back to action_add_header.  Based on patch from Matthew van Eerde.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added new function md_get_bogus_mx_hosts.
	Allows to test for sender domains with bogus MX hosts (such as
	hosts that resolve to the loopback or private IP addresses.)

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Invoke the "fsav" virus scanner with the --mime
	option.  Fix courtesy of Mack Wharton.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Correctly interpret kavscanner return code 9
	(password-protected ZIP.)  Fix courtesy of Mack Wharton.

2005-11-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.55-BETA-1 RELEASED

	* examples/init-script.in: Fix typo that resulted in the shell
	complaining of a syntax error (pointed out by Jason Englander).

	* Clean up man pages by removing some obsolete material.

	* mimedefang.c: Do NOT strip "bare CR" characters from e-mails by
	default.  The new "-c" command-line option enables the older behavior.

	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***  WE NO LONGER STRIP BARE CR's FROM
				      MESSAGES BY DEFAULT.  TEST YOUR FILTERS
				      CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN COPE
				      WITH THIS, OR USE THE -c FLAG.

	* mimedefang.c(rcptto): If you returned ACCEPT_AND_NO_MORE_FILTERING
	from filter_recipient, the spool files wouldn't get cleaned up,
	eventually clogging the spool directory.  This has been fixed.

	* mimedefang.pl.in(interpret_hbedv_code): Fix interpretation of
	H+BEDV return codes (pointed out by Henning Schmiedehausen).

2005-11-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.54 RELEASED

	* Makefile and configure script now allow MIMEDefang to be built
	against a shared library version of libmilter (libmilter.so).

	* Added experimental support for Kaspersky "kavscanner".

	* Both mimedefang and mimedefang-multiplexor now accept a
	"-z spooldir" argument so you can move the spool directory
	away from the compiled-in default at run-time.

2005-09-07  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.53 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-protocol.7.in: Documented the "map" and "tick"
	protocol commands.

	* Remove call to anomy_clean_html from sample filter.
	Anomy::HTMLCleaner is simply way too buggy for production use.

2005-08-30  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.53-BETA-2 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl.in: If clamd fails with a "Zip module error",
	we fall back on "clamscan --unzip".  If both clamscan and
	unzip are installed, this lets us handle "deflate64" compression,
	which is NOT available in libz or clamd.

2005-08-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.53-BETA-1 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Add more load commands: load-relayok,
	load-senderok and load-recipok to time processing of relayok,
	senderok and recipok callbacks.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Reset SIGCHLD handler after creating
	embedded Perl interpreter.  Designed to work around problems with
	SpamAssassin 3.1RC1.

	* mimedefang.c: Always create an empty HEADERS file, even if
	(somehow) we get an e-mail with no headers.

	* mimedefang.pl: Correctly set $Features{"Virus:FileScan"}

	* mimedefang.pl(takeStabAtFilename): Do not use the Content-Decription
	field as an indication of the filename.

2005-06-01  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.52 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl.in (item_contains_virus_fprotd): Remove all
	references to $` and $', which can SIGNIFICANTLY slow down
	Perl regexp matching.

2005-03-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c(mfconnect): Do not call set_dsn from mfconnect,
	because the Milter API specifies that you can't call smfi_setreply
	from the connect callback.

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Document the fact that filter_relay
	cannot set the text of the SMTP reply code.

2005-02-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  mimedefang.pl: We don't detect and load Perl modules until
	the detect_and_load_perl_modules() function is called.

	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	You *MUST* call detect_and_load_perl_modules() inside your filter
	before you can rely on the %Features hash being set correctly,
	and before you can rely on SpamAssassin being loaded!!!

2005-02-08  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* VERSION 2.51 RELEASED

	Note: There was no public 2.50 release; the 2.50 version was a
	private release that was available only with CanIt.

	*  Added "-q" option to mimedefang.  This permits the multiplexor
	to queue new incoming connections.  It may make higher utilization
	of workers and improve throughput.

	* ESMTP arguments in MAIL FROM: and RCPT TO: are now available
	to the Perl filter.  See the mimedefang-filter(5) man page for
	details.

	* Documentation fixes: We don't refer to non-multiplexor mode
	any more, because that mode hasn't been available for ages.

	* The "tick" facility has been enhanced to permit multiple tick
	types.  At any given instance, only one tick of a given type
	can be active, but ticks of different types can be active at
	the same time.

	* Log a warning if a message has more than one Subject: header.

2004-11-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.49 RELEASED

	* README: Fixed URL for wvware tools.  (Brad Tarver)

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Corrected error in documentation.
	The man page used to state (incorrectly) that if the host name
	could not be resolved, it was set to the host IP address.
	In fact, it's set to [host.ip.addr.ess] with square brackets.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Insist that argument to -s switch
	be a UNIX-domain socket.

	* mimedefang.c: protect inet_ntoa with a mutex (for those systems
	that lack inet_ntop).

	* mimedefang.c: Fix stupid logic error that made MIMEDefang ignore
	the Sendmail {if_addr} macro when setting IP address for
	X-Scanned-By: header.

	* embperl.c: Soften warning about file descriptors being opened
	in filter.  Some systems seem to do this (Solaris).

	* mimedefang.pl.in (synthesize_received_header): Add
	(envelope-sender $Sender) comment as desired by SpamAssassin:
	http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/EnvelopeSenderInReceived

	* mimedefang.pl.in (interpret_nvcc_code): Handle return code
	of 11 from Norman Virus Control as "suspicious".

2004-10-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.48 RELEASED

	* Fix dumb bugs introducted in 2.46 and 2.47 related to
	worker status reports.

	* embperl.c: Detect if user opens file descriptors inside his/her
	filter.  If so, log a loud and nasty warning that such code should
	be moved to filter_initialize.

2004-10-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.47 RELEASED

	* Move worker "status reports" onto their own file descriptor.
	If you want the status reports, you must invoke mimedefang-multiplexor
	with the "-Z" flag.  In the sample init scripts, set
	MX_STATUS_UDPATES=yes

2004-10-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.46 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Added mechanism for workers to send
	back "status reports" to the multiplexor.  The command
	"md-mx-ctrl workers" now shows the current status of busy workers
	(eg, "Running SpamAssassin", "recipok <addr@domain.net>", etc.)

	* redhat/mimedefang-init.in: Unconditionally execute "ulimit -s 2048"
	before invoking mimedefang.

2004-10-28 Bill Maidment <bill@maidment.com.au>

	* Added support for Command "csav" anti-virus.

2004-10-27  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.46-BETA-2 released.

	* mimedefang.c: Print and log an error if we can't determine our
	own IP address.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: append_html_boilerplate and append_text_boilerplate
	refuse to tamper with S/MIME messages.  They won't descend into
	multipart/signed or multipart/encrypted parts.  Similarly for
	remove_redundant_html_parts.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Split-and-rebuild algorithm is greatly improved.
	In particular:  In filter_end, the $entity->head correctly contains
	all message headers.  And we try to avoid creating useless
	multipart containers -- if we would end up with a multipart/mixed
	or multipart/alternative with only one sub-part, we "pop" the sub-part
	up to the top level.

2004-10-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.46-BETA-1 released.

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Corrected an error in one of the examples

	* mimedefang.c: Add IP address of scanning host to X-Scanned-By:
	header.

	* SECURITY FIX: mimedefang.c: Tempfail message if RESULTS file
	doesn't terminate with 'F' line.  (Detects disk-full condition.)

	* mimedefang.pl.in (rebuild_entity): Add a Content-Type: header
	if MIME part lacks one.  Some marginal e-mail software chokes on
	a part with a missing content-type header.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: flatten_mime removed.  Support for
	$Stupidity{"flatten"} removed.  *** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* action_add_part revamped completely; we try to preserve original
	multipart type of message.  action_add_part now simply keeps a list
	of parts to be added.  At the end:

		a) If original message was multipart/mixed, we simply add
		the part.

		b) Otherwise, we make a new multipart/mixed container, put
		original message as the first part of this new container, and
		then add part to the multipart/mixed container.

		*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* Proper multipart type passed to filter_end.

	* All mimedefang.pl-generated messages have an
	Auto-Submitted: auto-generated header.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Return codes of I/O operations are checked; we
	die if any fail.  This is a security fix.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (interpret_trend_code): Treat any code from
	1 to 9 as indicative of a virus, upon recommendation of Stephane Lentz.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_init): Add a
	LOCAL_RULES_DIR => @CONFDIR@/spamassassin argument to SpamAssassin
	constructor.

2004-09-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.45 RELEASED

2004-09-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Add the "-a" command-line option
	for opening a socket that only allows unprivileged commands.
	These are commands that fetch status, but can't affect operation
	of multiplexor.

2004-09-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.45-BETA-4 released.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Put a "use libs" directive at the top to
	use Perl modules from the "site" directory before searching the
	core directory.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added filter_create_parser user-supplied
	callback to create a MIME::Parser object.  This lets you customize
	how parsing happens.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.8.in: Added warning that "$$" will be
	incorrect if you use embedded Perl.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Keep track of "age" of workers, and
	track activations and reaps over last 10 minutes.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Add new notification messages: "B"
	indicates a busy timeout, and "U" indicates unexpected worker death.

	* mimedefang.c: Add "-b" option to set the backlog parameter in
	listen(2).

	* notifier.c: Fixed (harmless) bug which would attempt to send out
	notifications even if no notification socket was specified.  It
	would just waste a tiny bit of CPU time before.

	* watch-mimedefang.in: Fix Tcl code so you can run watch-mimedefang
	on a Windows box, monitoring the mail server via SSH.

2004-09-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_check_against_smtp_server): Add optional
	$port argument to specify checking against a port other than 25.

2004-08-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.45-BETA-3 released.

	* Makefile.in: Prevent sa-mimedefang.cf from being overwritten.

	* mimedefang.filter.5.in:  Correct some documentation errors.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added and documented read_commands_file function
	so that you can initialize certain global variables in
	filter_sender and filter_recipient.  Code contributed by
	Jan Pieter Cornet.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Log UNIX error code if problem
	communicating with a worker.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Implement new commands "help",
	"workers", and "workerinfo".

	* watch-mimedefang: added -command, -interval, -10s, -1m, -5m,
	-10m and -title command-line options.

	* mimedefang.pl.in(message_contains_virus_clamd): Time out if
	clamd doesn't respond in 8 seconds.  Based on a patch from Chris
	Myers.

	* mimedefang-spec.in: Fix error in %preun script.

	* watch-mimedefang.in: Many bug fixes.

2004-07-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.45-BETA-2 released.

	* Makefile.in: Do not overwrite /etc/mail/sa-mimedefang.cf in
	install-redhat target

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Track average latency of scan commands.

	* watch-mimedefang.in: Huge rewrite.  Displays a lot more info about
	the MIMEDefang server.  Can monitor a remote MIMEDefang server over
	a low-bandwidth SSH connection.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Log helpful messages if clamd fails with an
	error (Tomas Kopal)

	* md-mx-ctrl.c: Support the "-i" command-line option to read commands
	from stdin and send results to stdout.  Used to support
	watch-mimedefang's low-bandwidth remote monitoring.


2004-07-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.45-BETA-1 released.

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Clarified description of action_bounce.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Added support for keeping "load average"
	histories so you can see how loaded your system is.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Raw 'status' output includes time when
	multiplexor was first started.

	* md-mx-ctrl.8.in: Documented new 'load' and 'rawload' commands.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Implemented a new set of RBL lookup functions
	that perform multiple lookups in parallel and allow you to set
	a timeout (the timeout applies to ALL lookups, not each individual
	lookup.)  These new functions require the Net::DNS module.

	* md-mx-ctrl.c: Implement 'load' and 'rawload' commands.

2004-07-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  Version 2.44 RELEASED

2004-07-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Move /etc/mail/spamassassin/sa-mimedefang.cf to
	/etc/mail/sa-mimedefang.cf   *** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* README, README.ANOMY, README.NONROOT, README.SOPHIE,
	README.SPAMASSASSIN: Update some README files that haven't been
	touched in ages.

	* configure.in: Remove --enable-running-on-scummy-sco command-line
	option.

	* configure.in: Hard-code a successful test for "wait3" on Solaris 9.

	* mimedefang.c: Add -v option to print version and exit.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Add -v option to print version and exit.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Check that the "IP Validation Header" begins
	with X-MIMEDefang-Relay and refuse to use it if not.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (sigterm): If multiplexor is killed,
	we kill all workers with SIGTERM.  We wait for up to 10 seconds, and
	if there are still workers that haven't exited, we kill them
	with SIGKILL.

2004-06-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.44-BETA-1 released.

	* NEW: Support for Sendmail's SOCKETMAP map class.  See
	mimedefang-filter(5) and mimedefang-multiplexor(8) for details.
	This code has been present for a long time, but was commented
	out; it is now enabled.

	* NEW: Support for Sendmail's QUARANTINE feature.  This leaves
	quarantined messages in your mail queue, and is NOT THE SAME as
	MIMEDefang's quarantine.  See the Sendmail documentation for
	details.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: If platform does not safely support an
	embedded Perl interpreter, return an informative message when user
	does "md-mx-ctrl reread".

	* embperl.c: Fix a memory leak that apparently occurs on FreeBSD.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Add "Precedence: bulk" headers to all
	MIMEDefang-generated notifications.

	* configure.in: Fix a couple of typos

	* configure.in: Check for Unix::Syslog or Sys::Syslog, even
	if invoked with --disable-check-perl-modules

	* init scripts: Kill mimedefang with TERM rather than KILL signal,
	and wait for it to exit.

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Correct error in documentation of
	md_check_against_smtp_server.


2004-05-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*  Version 2.43 RELEASED

2004-05-07  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* filter_relay, filter_sender and filter_recipient can return
	a fifth element specifying a delay before returning a code
	to the SMTP client.  This lets you implement tarpitting without
	tying up a Perl worker.  However, the delay does tie up a libmilter
	thread.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: If resending a message fails during streaming,
	we bounce the message and log an error at LOG_CRIT importance.

	* Modified C and Perl code so that filter_relay is called
	when remote client connects rather than after MAIL FROM.
	This means the $helo argument is NOT available!

	   *** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	filter_relay no longer has access to the HELO argument, nor
	does the MIMEDefang spool directory exist when filter_relay is called.

2004-04-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Add -X option to run a "tick" request
	every so often.  Added -Y option to set syslog label.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Call md_openlog lazily so users can call it from
	filter to change syslog label.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added hooks for filter_tick routine.

2004-03-31  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.42 RELEASED

2004-03-30  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* redhat/mimedefang-init.in: Use "md-mx-ctrl reread" in preference
	to "kill -INT" to force a rules reread.

2004-03-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_copy_orig_msg_to_work_dir): Added
	md_copy_orig_msg_to_work_dir and
	md_copy_orig_msg_to_work_dir_as_mbox_file functions to help
	virus-scanners that want the entire message, or want it in
	UNIX mbox format.

2004-03-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.42-BETA-1

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_mail): Add support for
	SpamAssassin 3.0.0's new Perl API.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (activateWorker): Call closelog() so
	embedded Perl interpreter doesn't accidentally reuse syslog
	file decriptor (Josh Kelley)

2004-03-16  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.41 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl.in (send_quarantine_notifications): Include
	host name in quarantine mail body (Dirk Mueller).

	instead of 0700.

2004-03-09  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (entity_contains_virus_clamd): Check for "ERROR"
	return message from clamd (Nate Carlson).

	(action_quarantine_entire_message): Do not send out an e-mail
	message if $msg is non-blank (pointed out by many users...)

	(entity_contains_virus_hbedv): Replace -allfiles with correct
	--allfiles (Ken Cormack)

	(entity_contains_virus_sophos): Add -mime option for Sophos sweep
	(Dirk Mueller)

2004-03-05  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.40 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl.in (entity_contains_virus_avp5): Added support
	for Kaspersky "aveclient" program, based on patch from
	Enrico Ansaloni.

2004-03-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (re_match_in_zip_directory): Added function
	to look inside zip archives (if Archive::Zip is installed) to
	do filename matching.  Modified example filter to call it.

2004-03-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.40-BETA-3

	* mimedefang.pl.in (do_scan): Make a replica of INPUTMSG under
	Work/ so that virus-scanners with built-in MIME decoders can
	have a crack at the original input message.  Also added --mbox
	option for clamscan.

2004-03-01  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (action_quarantine_entire_message): Do not include
	$msg argument in original mail; just use it in admin notification.

2004-02-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Documentation and cosmetic fixes from Matt Selsky.

	* Loosened spool directory permissions -- made them group-readable
	so you can run ClamAV as its own user (as long as it's in the defang
	group.)

	* Modified spec file to allow detection of AV software at
	build time using --with 'antivirus' (From No. 6)

2004-02-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_openlog): Added LOG_NDELAY option
	(Recommended by "Don")

	(entity_contains_virus_trend): Added "-a" option and other minor
	fixes from "Number 6".

2004-02-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.40-BETA-2

	* notifier.c: Added the multiplexor "notification" facility.
	This is an experimental new interface that lets the multiplexor
	inform external programs about state changes; see the
	mimedefang-notify(7) man page for details.

2004-02-11  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (interpret_hbedv_code): Make the regexp that
	picks out virus name for Vexira and H+BEDV more forgiving.

2004-02-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Just
	discard viruses.  Don't bother checking each entity.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (entity_contains_virus_trend): Use the "-za"
	flag (suggested by "Number 6")

2004-01-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.40-BETA-1.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Enable "use warnings" so we get warnings
	even in embedded interpreter.  (problem noted by Dave O'Neill).

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added message_contains_virus and
	entity_contains_virus functions to mimedefang.pl.in.  They use
	*every* installed virus scanner.  Based on idea from Chris Myers.

		*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	The previous example filter defined functions called
	message_contains_virus and entity_contains_virus.  These are
	now defined in mimedefang.pl itself; you should remove the
	definitions from your filter!

2004-01-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Remove
	all action_quarantine* from sample filter.

2004-01-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* contrib/fang.pl (make_message): Patch to handle multiple parts
	(contributed by Eric Emerson).

2004-01-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Fix bug in BDC virus-scanner detection

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Remove confusing "8.12.9/8.12.9" text from
	synthesized Received: header

	* mimedefang.pl.in: use MIME::Entity::dup() to fix destruction
	of multipart/digest messages.  Fix due to Bryan Stansell.

2004-01-08  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Use $PERL everywhere, not perl.  Patch submitted
	by Jeff Makey

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients (filter_end):
	Remove call to remove_redundant_html_parts from default filter.

2003-12-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (interpret_sweep_code): Return 'ok' for a
	Sophos return code of 2.  Sophos Sweep seems to choke on
	M$ docs; this is dangerous!!  Use another virus-scanner if
	possible.

2003-11-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.39 RELEASED

2003-11-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	in bad filename regular expression.

2003-11-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.39-BETA-1.

2003-11-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Added support for embedding a
	Perl interpreter, which should improve performance a fair bit.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added support for "filter_initialize" function
	that gets called once each time a worker is activated.  If you
	are using an embedded Perl interpreter, read the mimedefang-filter
	man page carefully, especially the INITIALIZATION AND CLEANUP
	section!

2003-10-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (doStatus): Fix memory leak in
	doStatus.

	(doHistogram): Added "histo" command to md-mx-ctrl.  It prints
	a histogram showing how often a given number of workers have been
	busy.

2003-10-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Makefile (MANIFEST): Updated contrib/graphdefang to
	graphdefang 0.9 (contributed by John Kirkland).

2003-10-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (entity_contains_virus_filescan): Set
	$CurrentVirusScannerMessage (problem noted by Ernst Du Plooy)

2003-10-09  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (serverloop): Fixed a bug in which recipient
	address was sometimes percent-escaped (eg "foo'bar@domain.net"
	became "foo%27bar@domain.net").  Problem noted by
	Patrick Morris.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Made
	the filter_bad_filename tests less paranoid.

2003-10-08  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	is detected.

2003-09-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.h: Change SMALLBUF definition from 4096 to 16384 for
	longer SpamAssassin reports.

2003-09-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Fixed typo in --help output.

2003-09-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.37 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-multiplexor: Set FD_CLOEXEC flag on most descriptors
	so they are closed when Perl filter executed.

2003-09-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (envfrom): Fixed bug whereby a file descriptor
	was leaked for _each_ message if -C flag given.

2003-08-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.36 RELEASED

2003-08-11  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: Make more conservative use of file descriptors.
	Added "-C" option to enable ultra-conservative use of file
	descriptors (by closing/reopening files in each callback.)

2003-08-08  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.36-BETA-3 released.

	* Added support for Bitdefender's bdc scanner
	(http://www.bitdefender.com).  Based on code suggested by
	Philipp Baer.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Always
	add X-Spam-Score header if we run SpamAssassin.

2003-08-05  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.36-BETA-2 released.

	* Makefile.in: "clean" target removes md-mx-ctrl (from Debian patch)

	* configure.in, utils.c: Try harder to get a reasonable
	definition of uint32_t

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Proper
	regexp to detect CLSID attacks (Nik Clayton)

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Fixed typos.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Check more stringently on the context of functions
	called by the filter.

2003-07-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* MIMEDefang 2.36-BETA-1 released.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c, mimedefang.c:  Added -D option
	to stay in foreground instead of daemonizing (Ben Kamen).

	* examples/init-script.in: Added MD_EXTRA variable (Jeremy Mates).

	* configure.in: Search for and use <stdint.h>

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Clarify availability of global variables.

	* mimedefang.c: Get rid of last use of stdio in non-scalable
	location.  Check every single smfi_xxxx callback for success
	and log a message on failure.

2003-07-11  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Initialize $SALocalTestsOnly to 1.

2003-07-02  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.35 RELEASED

	* Documentation cleanups.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Replace multiple incorrect instances of
	"sock" with "$sock".

	(action_notify_administrator): action_notify_administrator can
	be called OUTSIDE a message context, in which case it immediately
	sends e-mail to the administrator.  (Suggested by Dirk Mueller.)

	(action_replace_with_url):  Added optional "$salt" argument to
	perturb SHA1 hash calculation and avoid leaking information about
	whether an attachment has been received.  Problem noted by
	Jeffrey Goldberg.

	(gen_date_msgid_headers): Generate proper time zone information in
	Date: and Received: headers.  Noted by Stephane Lentz.

2003-06-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.34 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Added "-I" option so you can
	specify the "backlog" argument to listen(2).  Suggested
	by Kevin Brierly.

	* mimedefang.c: Added 'DISCARD' return value for filter_relay,
	filter_sender and filter_recipient (suggested by Ernst Du Plooy).

2003-06-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Added "-q" and "-Q" options.  These
	are experimental; they allow requests to be queued until
	workers become free, rather than failing them immediately.
	See the mimedefang-multiplexor(8) man page for details.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (action_replace_with_url): Added optional
	fifth $cd_data (suggested by Jeremy Mates).

	(action_replace_with_warning): Name the warnings warning1.txt,
	warning2.txt, etc. instead of all warning.txt.  Suggested by
	Steffen Kaiser.

	(interpret_nai_code): Handle (ED) in parsing of uvscan output.
	(Noted by Jeremy McCarty).

2003-06-19  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (entity_contains_virus_filescan): If File::Scan
	is not installed, return "not-installed" instead of "tempfail"
	(Problem noted by Richard Laager).

	* mimedefang.c: Added "-a" command-line option to pass additional
	Sendmail macros through to the filter.

2003-06-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Sample
	filter pre-compiles SpamAssassin rules; this may improve
	performance.  Idea from Richard Laager

2003-06-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* REMOVED support for RAV Antivirus.  *** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2003-06-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* redhat/mimedefang-init: Copy the PID files into /var/run to
	keep Red Hat's silly killproc() function happy.

	* redhat/mimedefang-spec.in: The spec file now generates two
	RPM's: mimedefang and mimedefang-contrib

	* Renamed md_log to md_graphdefang_log.

	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	YOU MUST update your filter, and change all instances of
	"md_log_enable" to "md_graphdefang_log_enable" and
	"md_log" to "md_graphdefang_log"

2003-06-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Experimental support for Sendmail SOCKETMAP feature (currently
	disabled because it requires a Sendmail patch.)

	* New feature: Added the filter_unknown_cmd hook so user-filters
	can extend the MIMEDefang protocol.  Updated md-mx-ctrl as well.
	See mimedefang-protocol(7) and mimedefang-filter(5) for details.

2003-05-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* SpamAssassin/spamassassin.cf: Tidied things up a bit.  Added
	comments about how SA cannot modify the e-mail if used from
	MIMEDefang.

	* configure.in: Add /opt/rav/bin to ANTIVIR_PATH

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_mail): More fixes to the
	headers that get generated for SpamAssassin (Dirk Mueller).
	Also created and documented the $AddApparentlyToForSpamAssassin
	variable.

2003-05-27  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_mail): Fix the way the
	synthesized Received: header was handed to SpamAssassin.

	* configure.in: Changed default location of quarantine directory
	to /var/spool/MD-Quarantine.  *** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***
	Use --with-quarantinedir=/var/spool/MIMEDefang if you want the
	old behaviour.

	* mimedefang.c: Removed support for non-multiplexor operation.
	It is now mandatory to use the multiplexor.
	*** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2003-05-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, mimedefang.pl.in, README.SOPHIE:
	Improved Sophie support, courtesy of Jason Englander.

2003-05-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Makefile.in: "make install" target obeys DESTDIR (as well
	as former RPM_INSTALL_ROOT) to change installation root.

2003-05-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Check for socket errors when talking to
	daemonized virus scanners like Sophie, Trophie, Clamd and
	CarrierScan, and return tempfail on error.  Problem noted
	by Chris Stromsoe and Dave Shrimpton.

	(relay_is_blacklisted): Rather than just returning true or
	false, we return the actual DNS lookup value (like "127.0.0.2")
	if a host is in a DNS-based blacklist.  Feature requested by
	Matthew Hall.

	* Tempfail codes default to 451/4.3.0 rather than 450/4.7.1.
	These new codes are more consistent and in line with
	RFCs 2821 and 1893.

2003-05-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Because of SCO's disgusting behaviour,
	MIMEDefang will refuse to build on SCO UNIX or SCO Linux
	unless you supply the --enable-running-on-scummy-sco configure
	option.

2003-05-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Documented md_syslog.  md_syslog
	is now an officially-supported API function.

	* mimedefang.c (mfconnect): Do not use strncpy in
	potentially-unsafe way (Dirk Mueller)

	* mimedefang.c, mimedefang.pl.in: Allow Perl filters to specify
	SMTP reply codes (4xx, 5xx) and DSN status codes (4.x.y, 5.x.y)
	(Suggested by user "jkohan" on the MIMEDefang Web site.)

	* mimedefang.pl.in: md_check_against_smtp_server returns the
	same SMTP reply code and DSN status as the forwarding server
	(rather than its own codes on failure.)

2003-04-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.33 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.c: Clean up working directory sooner in many different
	places.

	* mimedefang.c(eom): Delete all but the first "Content-Type:" header
	in the e-mail message, and log a warning if there is more than one
	such header.

2003-04-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* syslog-fac.c: Added "-S" option to mimedefang and
	mimedefang-multiplexor to set syslog facility.  Also, created
	and documented global variable $SyslogFacility in mimedefang-filter.

2003-04-19  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (synthesize_received_header): Add a Received:
	header when remailing messages.

2003-04-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.32 RELEASED

	* The function filter_recipient gets passed three additional
	arguments: $rcpt_mailer, $rcpt_host and $rcpt_addr, which are
	taken from the corresponding Sendmail macros.  See the Sendmail
	documentation for more information.

	     *** NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY ***  filter_recipient is passed
	     three additional arguments; if you use function prototypes,
	     you may need to adjust your filter!

	* From filter_begin to filter_end, the hash %RecipientMailers
	contains rcpt_mailer, rcpt_host and rcpt_addr for each recipient.

	* Added support for Vexira Virus Scanner from Central Command,
	courtesy of John Rowan Littell.

2003-04-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (get_quarantine_dir): Save Sendmail queue-ID
	in quarantine directory.

2003-04-11  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_check_against_smtp_server): Add a timeout
	of 15 seconds to the socket connect call; otherwise, a down
	downstream SMTP server could cause the worker to be killed.

2003-03-27  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (envfrom): When we create the spool directory,
	call it "mdefang-qid" where "qid" is the Sendmail queue identifier.
	If this fails, we fall back to the old way of generating spool
	directory names.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (replace_entire_message): Added
	replace_entire_message function to replace the entire message
	with a user-supplied MIME::Entity in filter_end.

2003-03-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Use the "-oi" option to Sendmail when
	resending messages (Michael Sofka).

2003-03-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_log_enable): Added optional
	$enum_recips argument to control whether a line is logged for
	each recipient, or just a single line per message. (John Kirkland)

	* mimedefang.pl.in (gen_date_msgid_headers): We add proper
	"Date:" and "Message-ID:" headers to internally-generated
	MIMEDefang notifications.

2003-03-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.31 RELEASED

2003-03-13  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Manual page fixes

	* Add support for FPROTD scanner, courtesy of
	Steffen Kaiser

	* Add support for remote scanning with Symantec
	CarrierScan Server.

2003-03-05  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (doStatusLog): Added "-L" option
	to mimedefang-multiplexor to periodically log worker status.

	CarrierScan Server virus scanner.

2003-03-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (serverloop): Escape "<" and ">" if
	$AddWarningsInline is true and we're appending the warning to an
	HTML part (Mickey Hill).

2003-03-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Makefile.in (MANIFEST): Sync to version 0.7 of graphdefang
	(John Kirkland)

2003-02-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added remove_redundant_html_parts() to delete HTML
	parts if a corresponding text/plain part is present in the message.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Major changes to the internal logic
	of the worker scheduler.  Should be more efficient than the old
	system.

2003-02-27  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (putOnFreeList): Fix logic errors
	in putOnFreeList and putOnBusyList

2003-02-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: Reduce the use of stdio library to avoid hitting
	limits on the number of streams.  Problem discovered by Nik
	Clayton.

2003-02-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Updated documentation (mimedefang-filter.5, mimedefang-protocol.7)
	to reflect current reality.

	* mimedefang.c (mfconnect): Added support for IPv6 addresses
	in mfconnect

	* mimedefang.pl: The global variable $MsgID is set to the Sendmail
	queue identifier in filter_relay, filter_sender and filter_recipient.

2003-02-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.30 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: On systems that support wait3 and fill
	in the usage structure, we log the worker's system and user CPU
	usage when it exits.  The autoconf test is not too reliable on
	Solaris; sorry...

	* Create the temporary spool directory before calling filter_relay;
	store it in $CWD for filter_relay, filter_sender, filter_recipient,
	and the other filter functions, so we can pass state around.

2003-01-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Officially deprecated non-use of the multiplexor.  I plan
	on dropping support for non-multiplexor operation by 31 July 2003.

	* mimedefang.c: A few typos fixed.

	* mimedefang.c: Better syslog messages on certain system call failures.

	* mimedefang.c: Added -M option to protect work directory
	creation with a mutex.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: resend_message returns a meaningful value
	(true on success; false on failure.)

2003-01-27  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (envfrom): Fix potential descriptor leak.  Problem
	noted by Nik Clayton.

	* mimedefang.c (envfrom): Fixed some incorrect syslog messages.
	Problem noted by Nik Clayton.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Add handling for filter_cleanup, that
	lets you run Perl code just before a worker is killed.  Based on
	a suggestion by Brian Landers.

2003-01-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.29 RELEASED

	* COPYING (IMPORTANT NOTE): IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION ABOUT MIMEDEFANG'S
	LICENSE.  PLEASE READ THE FILE "COPYING" VERY CAREFULLY.

	* Update contrib/graphdefang to version 0.6

2003-01-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (send_mail): Redirect sendmail's STDOUT to
	STDERR; otherwise, complaints from Sendmail can mess up the
	communication between the multiplexor and the workers.

2003-01-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: Added -x option to set content of X-Scanned-By:
	header.

2002-12-30  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* event_tcp.c (handle_readable): Multiplexor reads commands
	in chunks rather than a character at a time.  Greatly reduces
	system-call overhead, but not likely to make much difference
	except on incredibly busy mail servers.

2002-12-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Add support for Trophie scanning library.
	(Jason Englander)

	* Makefile.in: Clean up md-mx-ctrl in make distclean (Jason Englander)

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Add global $CWD variable so we don't need to
	exec pwd to find current working directory.

2002-12-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Log the Sendmail QUEUE-ID in most logging messages
	(mimedefang.c, mimedefang.pl.in)

2002-12-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.28 RELEASED

	* configure.in: Added --enable-pthread-flag to force use of
	"-pthread" C compiler flag (required for Tru64 UNIX)

	* mimedefang.c (body): Added hackish workaround for an optimization
	bug in gcc 3.2 on Sparc Solaris.

2002-12-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_mail): Synthesize "Return-Path:"
	and "Received:" headers for SpamAssassin (Nels Lindquist).

2002-12-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: For filter_relay, filter_sender and filter_recipient,
	use 'CONTINUE', 'TEMPFAIL' and 'REJECT' instead of 1, -1, and 0.
	Also add 'ACCEPT_AND_NO_MORE_FILTERING' to accept mail without
	further processing.  The old numeric return codes still work,
	but are deprecated.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (MAX_CMD_LEN): Increased MAX_CMD_LEN
	to 4096 from 512.

2002-12-05  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Fixed many typos (Jason Englander)

2002-12-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (findFreeWorker): Do not return
	a killed-but-not-yet-reaped worker.

2002-12-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.27 RELEASED

2002-12-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Count all worker commands as a "request",
	not just a "scan" command.  Increase MX_MAXIMUM default to 200
	from 100 to compensate.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: More explicit log messages.

	* redhat/mimedefang-init: Call "ulimit -s 2048" if we're using
	lots of workers with the multiplexor.  This prevents pthreads
	from complaining on Linux if you create hundreds of threads.
	(Brad Dameron)

2002-11-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (recipient_ok): Set global variables in
	filter_relay, filter_sender and filter_recipient based on the
	information available so far in the SMTP transaction. (Anne Bennet)

	* mimedefang.c: Fix warnings about const/non-const and
	signed/unsigned conversions (Anne Bennet)

2002-11-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* md-mx-ctrl.c (MXCommand): Better error message for common
	case of permission denied.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fix regular expression code so we don't use
	$1 unless expression matched (Rudolph Pereira)

	* configure.in: Allow the use of either Unix::Syslog or Sys::Syslog,
	preferring Unix::Syslog if both are present.  MIMEDefang will
	now build if you have Unix::Syslog, but not Sys::Syslog.  Bug
	reported by Rudolph Pereira.

2002-11-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (findFreeWorker): When looking for
	a free worker, prefer one that is running over one that needs
	startup.  DOH!

2002-11-19  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.26 RELEASED

	* Quarantine notifications no longer sent unless you explicitly
	ask for them.

		      *** INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* mimedefang.pl.in (send_quarantine_notifications): Added
	send_quarantine_notifications routine which actually sends
	quarantine notifications.  Unless you call this function in
	filter_end, quarantine notifications are NO LONGER SENT.

	* contrib: Update to graphdefang-0.5 (John Kirkland)

2002-11-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.26-BETA-1 released.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_check_against_smtp_server): Added

	see mimedefang-filter(5) and the section
	"PRESERVING RELAY INFORMATION".

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added $RealRelayAddr and $RealRelayHostname
	which give the actual relay host, ignoring the IP address
	validation header.  (Used by CanIt.)

2002-11-05  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_version): Added md_version() function
	which returns MIMEDefang version.

2002-10-31  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (envfrom): Write out the value of the
	"verify" macro (Jeremy Mates)

2002-10-30  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	*mimedefang.pl.in: Remove append_boilerplate

	   *** INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	   The append_boilerplate function is gone.  It never really
	   worked properly.  Instead, use append_text_boilerplate and
	   append_html_boilerplate.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (message_contains_virus_clamd): Let clamd
	recurse through work directory.  Make sure you run Clam AntiVirus
	version 0.52 or higher! (Jason Englander)

	* watch-mimedefang: Now generated at configure time from
	watch-mimedefang.in.  Let's us specify @SPOOLDIR@
	(Jason Englander)

	* mimedefang.pl.in (md_syslog): Use "%s" formatting string
	to avoid problems with % characters in message (Steffen Kaiser)

	* mimedefang.c (mfconnect): Check return value of
	smfi_setpriv.

2002-10-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c, mimedefang-multiplexor.c: We now flat-out
	refuse to run as root.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Sample filter now calls action_bounce() for viruses and
	message/partial parts.

	* configure.in: Add /usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin to search
	path for virus scanners. (Douglas Hunley)

	* examples/init-script.in: Change @DEFANGUSER_DEFAULT@ to
	@DEFANGUSER@ (Andrey Pevnev)

2002-10-28  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Check for and obey "tempfail" suggested action from virus
	scanner (Martin Bene)

	* Forgot to mention that default location for multiplexor socket
	is now @SPOOLDIR@/mimedefang-multiplexor.sock.

2002-10-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.24 RELEASED

	* Makefile.in: Silence some warnings in "install" target.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Many functions which only make sense if
	called from filter_begin, filter, filter_multipart or filter_end
	syslog error messages if they are called from outside one of
	those functions.

	* md-mx-ctrl.c: Fix an off-by-one error.

	* watch-mimedefang: Minor GUI improvements.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (init_globals): Clear out globals after
	serverloop() so extraneous values don't hang around
	for filter_recipient, filter_relay and filter_sender

	* configure.in: Added --disable-anti-virus to turn off all
	searching for anti-virus programs.  Building with RPM uses this
	option; you can set $Features{'Virus:XXX'} directly in your
	filter.

	* redhat/mimedefang-spec.in: Use --disable-anti-virus when building
	RPM

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (activateWorker): Reset signal handlers
	to default before starting Perl filter program.

	* Added md-mx-ctrl program and watch-mimedefang GUI.  Tcl/Tk
	is required for "watch-mimedefang".

2002-10-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Do not generate /etc/mail/mimedefang-ip-key unless
	--with-ipheader configure argument given.

	* mimedefang-protocol.7.in: Updated protocol documentation.

	* mimedefang.c (body): Strip carriage-returns (\r) in C code
	before writing to INPUTMSG file.  Saves time in Perl filter
	and disk I/O.

	* rm_r.c: Allocate proper space for dirent entry.  Thanks to
	Heidi Hornstein

	* configure.in: Do not test for -pthread unless we're using
	gcc.  Thanks to Heidi Hornstein

	* mimedefang.pl.in (resend_message): Do not remove angle
	brackets from $Sender when resending message.

2002-10-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.23 RELEASED

	* SECURITY UPDATE: An attacker with sufficient bandwidth may be
	able to crash mimedefang-multiplexor for versions up to 2.22.
	This attack cannot be used to execute attacker's code; it's only a
	denial-of-service attack.  See next changelog entry for details:

	* event_tcp.c (handle_writeable): Check that state->f is
	non-NULL before dereferencing it.

	* event_tcp.c: Check for EINTR/EAGAIN on read() and write()
	system calls.

	* configure.in: Default DEFANGUSER to "defang" if
	--with-user not supplied.

2002-10-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.22 RELEASED

	* Added "-validate" flag to mimedefang.pl; see mimedefang.pl(8).
	Used by CanIt.

	* mimedefang and mimedefang-multiplexor chdir into the spool
	directory on startup.

2002-10-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Use Unix::Syslog if it's found at
	./configure time.

	* mimedefang.c (eom): The index argument to action_delete_header
	and action_change_header was not being obeyed.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added action_delete_all_headers

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added support for clamd daemonized virus-scanner
	(Jason Englander)

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fall back on setlogsock('inet') if
	setlogsock('unix') fails.  Also, check for this in configure
	script so we don't fill logs with error messages unnecessarily.
	Thanks to Brian Landers and others for assistance with this.

2002-10-08  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (eom): Log filter time even if we
	reject/discard/tempfail deliberately.  This is the first time I've
	used "goto" in a very long time... :-)

2002-10-07  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added $MaxMIMEParts variable to terminate parsing
	and bounce the message if there are more than $MaxMIMEParts parts.
	This does *NOT* work unless you use our specially-patched MIME::Tools
	package, MIME-tools-5.411a-RP-Patched-02 or newer.

	* Update contrib/graphdefang to version 0.3 (John Kirkland)

	* Execute "rm" to clean up on systems which lack readdir_r

	* Fix bug in "RAV" anti-virus invocation (was Linux-specific)

2002-10-02  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Add "-dl" to kavdaemon options (Marcelo)

	* Clarified SpamAssassin documentation.

	* Added -pthread flag when compiling rm_r.c.  May fix IRIX problems.

	* Compile two versions of drop_privs.c:  A threaded one for mimedefang
	and a non-threaded one for mimedefang-multiplexor.

	* configure fixes for Tru64 UNIX.  You may once again be able to
	use MIMEDefang with Sendmail 8.11.x.

	* Use sm_vsnprintf and sm_snprintf if platform lacks (v)snprintf
	Requires libsm.a in this case.

2002-10-01  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-filter.5.in: Clarified filter documentation,
	especially with regards to global variables.  Thanks
	to Tony Nugent for his useful post at
	http://lists.roaringpenguin.com/pipermail/mimedefang/2002-October/002576.html

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added $VirusName variable (John Kirkland)

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Added
	calls to md_log (John Kirkland)

2002-09-27  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* utils.c (MXCommand): Slightly better error messages

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added md_log_enable and md_log (John Kirkland)

2002-09-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* redhat/mimedefang-spec.in: Remove references to mime-tools-patch.txt;
	change group of spool dirs to "defang" (Stephane Lentz)

2002-09-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* rm_r.c (rm_r): Add compile-time option for forking/exec'ing
	/bin/rm to clean up, instead of using built-in C code.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (entity_contains_virus_sophos): Better
	regexp for filtering virus-scanner messages.
	(Michael McCarthy)

	* mimedefang.pl.in (action_defang): Make last
	three arguments to action_defang optional. (Ben Reser)

	* mimedefang.pl.in (anomy_clean_html): Workaround for Anomy
	"Use of uninitialized variable" errors (Aaron Paetznick)

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Add "MIME-Version: 1.0" and
	"Content-Type: text/plain" headers to internally-generated
	messages (Enrico Scholz)

2002-09-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (eom): Added "-T" option to mimedefang.

2002-09-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (envfrom): Log the directory name which could
	not be created if we were unable to create spool dir.

	* Version 2.21 RELEASED

	* Removed mime-tools-patch.txt.  Instead, download the patched
	MIME-Tools tarball from the MIMEDefang site.

	* Documented $WarningLocation

	* SECURITY UPDATE: Default filter rejects attachments of type
	"message/partial".  See
	http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/291514

2002-09-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (statsLog): Do not log the date/time
	if we log stats using syslog; it's redundant.  We still include
	a UNIX timestamp.

2002-09-06  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.20 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Quarantine functions try to make a
	hard link when copying messages; fall back to actual copy
	if hard link fails.  This can greatly improve performance.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	More "dangerous" extensions; tighter conditions for suspecting
	CLSID attack (thanks to Nik Clayton).

2002-09-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in:  The "-features" output includes
	MIMEDefang version as well as versions of selected Perl modules.

2002-08-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Added three new "dangerous" extensions: .app, .fxp and .prg.
	Thanks to Marco Berizzi.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Allow filenames like "foo@bar.com,innocuous.txt" rather
	than choking on the ".com," part.

	* mimedefang.c (cleanup): Use an internal C implementation of
	"rm -rf" rather than forking and execing /bin/rm.  This should
	improve performance on heavily-loaded systems.

2002-08-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Added --with-user=LOGIN configure-time option.
	We do not check for existence of this user at configure-time,
	because it would complicate building of RPM.

	* RPM creates "defang" user when installed.

	* Cleaned up configure script to use AC_MSG_xxx instead of echo
	in a lot of places.

2002-08-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.19 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.pl.in (signal_complete): Improved quarantine notification
	message.

	* Lowered some syslog output to "debug" level.

	* Fixed warnings about uninitialized variables.

	* "make install" target uses tighter permissions for
	/etc/mail/mimedefang-ip-key.  (This experimental feature is for
	future release.)

2002-08-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.18 RELEASED

	* All internally-generated messages and resent messages are
	delivered in "deferred" mode now.  IMPORTANT:  If you run
	Sendmail 8.12, you MUST run a "client-submission queue runner",
	something like this at system startup:

		      sendmail -Ac -qp1m

2002-08-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (eom): Fixed dumb error in which cmdFP was
	closed before the final command was written.

	* mimedefang.c (eom): Write a final 'F' line to signify end
	of COMMANDS file.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (send_mail): Invoke Sendmail with "-odb"
	(background delivery) rather than "-odi" (immediate delivery).

2002-08-13  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.17 RELEASED

	* mimedefang.c (helo): Added the $Helo global variable to hold
	"HELO/EHLO" argument.  Also, the HELO argument is passed to
	filter_relay, filter_sender and filter_recipient.  See the
	mimedefang-filter(5) man page for details and examples.

2002-07-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (serverloop): Experimental change:  Delete
	"\r" characters in message.  Seemed to cause lots of difficulty
	with MIME::Tools.

2002-07-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-protocol.7: Fixed typo:  "I" is used to change a
	header value, not "U".  Thanks to Mathias Herbert.

	* mimedefang.pl.in:  Fixed typo: "tmpfail" should have been "tempfail"

2002-07-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.16 RELEASED

2002-07-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Take out tests for libsm.a and libsmutil.a -- they
	are internal Sendmail libraries which should not be required.
	INCOMPATIBILITY:  YOU MUST NOW USE SENDMAIL 8.12.X

2002-07-16  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (rebuild_entity): Fixed incorrect setting of
	$ext for parts with no filename (thanks to Javier Kohan)
	(action_discard): Set $Actions{'discard'}

2002-07-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: Made X-Scanned-By: header a bit less verbose.

2002-07-11  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (entity_contains_virus_rav): Filter output of
	RAV to make it less verbose.
	(message_contains_virus_sophos): Filter output of Sophos to make
	it less verbose.

2002-07-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Filter the output of H+BEDV, NAI, TREND and AVP
	to make	output less verbose.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: message_contains_virus_trend: Fixed typo.

2002-07-08  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* utils.c (MXRecipientOK): Pass additional first_recipient argument
	to filter_recipient.

	* Added support for "Clam AntiVirus" (http://www.clamav.net/)
	courtesy of Dejan Muhamedagic

2002-07-05  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (run_virus_scanner): Added "$match" argument
	to pick out interesting lines from virus-scanner messages.

2002-07-05  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Integrated Norman Virus Control (nvcc)
	(http://www.norman.no/)

2002-07-04  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* utils.c: Allow filter_sender, filter_recipient and
	filter_relay to explicitly indicate a tempfail.

2002-06-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Better support for kav anti-virus
	(pointed out by Vadim Smelyansky)

	* redhat/mimedefang-spec.in: Minor fixes

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Fix for compilation problems
	on BSD.

2002-06-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.15 RELEASED

2002-06-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Added README.SECURITY

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Added
	calls to virus-scanner in sample filter.

	* Split mimedefang.c into mimedefang.c (milter-specific stuff)
	and utils.c (utilities for talking to multiplexor)

2002-06-13  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (message_contains_virus_rav): Fixed
	incorrect return code in message_contains_virus_rav

	* mimedefang-multiplexor: Added "-R" and "-M" options to
	limit memory usage of workers.  Strongly recommended to
	help mitigate DoS attacks.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (limit_mem_usage): Added ability
	to limit memory usage of workers to mitigate DoS attacks which
	use complicated MIME messages to consume lots of memory.  All
	such messages will be tempfailed forever, so keep an eye on
	your logs.  You'll see lines like this:

	Worker 0 stderr: Out of memory!
	Worker died prematurely -- check your filter rules


2002-06-11  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Added filter_recipient function; added ip and hostname arguments
	to filter_sender.  Improved mechanism for communicating with
	filter_sender, filter_relay and filter_recipient functions.

	* INCOMPATIBILITY:  filter_sender is now passed 3 arguments
	(sender, relay_ip, relay_hostname) instead of 1 (sender).  You
	may have to adjust your filter rules.

2002-06-07  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c, mimedefang.pl.in: Pass a number of sendmail macros
	down to the filter.

	* mimedefang.c: MAJOR internal change to communication mechanism
	between C and Perl.  Instead of lots of little files, the outbound
	(C to Perl) direction uses three files:

	INPUTMSG -- input message
	HEADERS  -- headers
	COMMANDS -- commands

	The inbound (Perl to C) uses (mostly) a single RESULTS file
	to pass results back.  If message is changed, we use a NEWBODY file.

2002-06-06  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (action_replace_with_warning): Try to keep
	warnings inline.

2002-06-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.14 RELEASED

2002-06-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Added support for --sysconfdir autoconf variable
	(which defaults to /etc, not PREFIX/etc].  Thanks to
	Andrey V. Pevnev.

	* configure.in: Added --with-confsubdir option (default mail)

	* configure.in: Added --with-milterinc and --with-milterlib
	arguments. (Thanks to Martin Matuska)

	* Added support for Sophie virus-scanning daemon, courtesy
	of Jason Englander.

	* Minor documentation cleanups.

	* Man pages are now generated by autoconf so they have correct
	path names.

2002-05-31  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (stream_by_recipient): Added
	stream_by_recipient function.

	* Version 2.13 RELEASED

2002-05-31  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Do not set Stupidity{"Flatten"}.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Proper handling of action_add_part for
	messages of type multipart/alternative.

2002-05-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/init-script.in: Generic init script which should work
	on most UNIXes.

	* mimedefang.c (main): Drop privileges as soon as possible in
	mimedefang and mimedefang-multiplexor.  That means you have to
	keep the pid files and sockets in /var/spool/MIMEDefang instead
	of /var/run.  YOU MAY HAVE TO ADJUST YOUR SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION!

2002-05-24  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added support for F-Risk F-Prot,
	courtesy of Javier Kohan.

2002-05-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.12 RELEASED

2002-05-23  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Moved SpamAssassin
	check to filter_end -- cleans up the code a bit.  Also reject
	filenames with curly brackets in them to prevent CLSID attacks.

	* mimedefang, mimedefang-multiplexor: Refuse to run suid or sgid.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Do not convert "multipart/alternative" to
	"multipart/mixed."

2002-05-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* We now have a Sparc/Solaris machine for development!  Thanks
	to Ben Kadish.

	* Fixed problem with not locating "libsm.a" on Solaris (and
	possibly other systems.)

2002-05-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added support for Trend Micro "vscan"
	virus scanner, courtesy of Stephane Lentz.  Stephane considers
	the code alpha-quality...

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Use MIME::Word's "decode_mimewords" function
	instead of MIME::WordDecoder's "unmime".  The latter would sometimes
	refuse to accept certain character sets.  decode_mimewords is
	potentially lossy, but should be safer than unmime.

2002-05-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: Did away with need for getpwnam_r; we do one
	password lookup and save results instead of doing a lookup in each
	thread.

2002-05-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* drop_privs.c: Add thread-safe workaround for systems which
	lack the getpwnam_r function.

2002-05-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* drop_privs.c: Use reentrant getpwnam_r routine instead of
	non-thread-safe getpwnam.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added $AddWarningsInline variable to add
	warnings right in the e-mail message text itself instead of
	adding an additional MIME part.

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Fixed typo (changed append_add_part to
	action_add_part).

	* configure.in: Added --disable-check-perl-modules option to
	skip Perl module checks.  Do not use this option unless you
	know exactly what you're doing!!!

2002-05-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Move default stats location to /var/log/mimedefang/stats to
	more easily accomodate -U option.

	* mimedefang.c: Added -U option to run as non-root user.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Added -U option to run as
	non-root user.

2002-05-14  Michael McLagan <Michael.McLagan@linux.org>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fixed RAV return code handling for non array
	requesting calls.

2002-05-14  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Added
	to list of banned extensions (thanks to Mickey Hill.)

 2002-05-14  Michael McLagan <Michael.McLagan@linux.org>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added spam_assassin_object and spam_assassin_mail

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Added spam_assassin _object and _mail
	descriptions and cleaned up language.

	* configure.in: Require SpamAssassin version >= 1.6.  Removed the
	SAVER check as it's not used anywhere.

2002-05-13  Michael McLagan <Michael.McLagan@linux.org>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added Reliable AntiVirus

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Added Reliable AntiVirus

	* configure.in: Added Reliable AntiVirus

2002-05-13  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.11 RELEASED

2002-05-13  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_status): Keep a single
	SpamAssassin object persistent rather than creating a new
	one for each spam check.

	* Fixed stupid typos in mimedefang.pl.in and configure.in

2002-05-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.10 RELEASED

2002-05-10  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (activateWorker): Added "-W" option
	to strictly limit rate of worker activation.

2002-05-09  Michael McLagan <Michael.McLagan@linux.org>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added action_add_part

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Added description for action_add_part

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Modified to use new function action_add_part

	* contrib/README: Added in linuxorg directory entry

	* contrib/linuxorg/README: A description of the files and how to
	install them.

	* contrib/linuxorg/filter: Included the filter file written for
	Linux Online & Linux Headquarters

	* contrib/linuxorg/spam-trusted-hosts: This lists hosts that we
	trust to insert proper SpamAssassin headers per the filter above.
	This file is a sample and it's empty.  NOTE from dfs:  Because
	this relies on message headers, it is possible to spoof, although
	real-world spammers would not likely do so.

	* contrib/linuxorg/spam-deliver: A collection of regex expressions
	which indicate email addresses to which SPAM mail is to be delivered
	to always, regardless of SpamAssassin's estimation of whether or not
	it is SPAM.  The sample file excludes abuse@ and postmaster@ from
	having their SPAM discarded

	* Makefile.in:	Modified install-redhat to create /etc/mail/mimedefang
	directory

	* Makefile.in: Modified to create mimedefang.spec from a .in file
	which will allow building BETA releases in addition to production ones.

	* redhat/mimedefang-spec.in: Created this file to use with above
	makefile change.  It's a copy of the old mimedefang.spec file which
	was in this directory.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added $config_file optional
	parameter to spam_assassin_* calls.

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Added optional $config_file to
	spam_assassin_* calls.  Added $OpenAVHost to list of global variables.

	* configure.in: dropped search for wvHtml since it's not used anymore

2002-05-09  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added append_text_boilerplate and
	append_html_boilerplate functions.  These actually add boilerplate
	text in a semi-sensible way that should work even with HTML
	mail.

2002-05-08  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Added "-F" option to mimedefang and mimedefang-multiplexor
	to specify filter rules files.

2002-05-07  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (serverloop): Do not add a level of nesting
	when we rebuild messages.

	* mimedefang.c (eom): Set MIME-Version if we're mucking with MIME
	headers.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Add SpamAssassin report as a separate text/plain type rather
	than appending boilerplate text to message.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added global variables $AdminName, $AdminAddress,
	$NotifySenderSubject, $NotifyAdministratorSubject, $QuarantineSubject,
	$NotifyNoPreamble, $SALocalTestsOnly as suggested by Michael McLagan.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added new %Features keys
	Virus:FileScan, Virus:OpenAV, Virus:NAI, Virus:HBEDV, Virus:SOPHOS,
	Virus:AVP and Virus:FSAV as suggested by Michael McLagan.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added prototypes to almost all Perl routines as
	suggested by Michael McLagan.

	* Added support for F-Secure "fsav" anti-virus as suggested by
	David Green.

2002-05-06  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* redhat/mimdefang-sysconfig: Added MX_WORKER_RATE variable.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fixed action_change_header to accept
	multiline headers.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c: Added "-w" option.  The multiplexor
	now waits a small period of time between worker activations rather
	than activating them all at once.  This should reduce the load
	on the server if you run many workers.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Do
	not call SpamAssassin for messages larger than 256kB.

	* event_tcp.c: Fixed syntax error if socklen_t not defined.

	* configure.in: Better detection of socklen_t typedef.

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Documented $DaemonName, $DaemonAddress
	and defang_warning.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients (filter):
	Call anomy_clean_html if Anomy::HTMLCleaner is installed.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (action_quarantine_entire_message): Added optional
	$msg argument which gets added to warning list and saved in
	quarantine dir.

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Documented $SuspiciousCharsInBody

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Fixed warnings about using uninitialized
	variables in sender_ok and relay_ok

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Renamed internal "sendmail" routine to
	"send_mail".

2002-05-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.9 RELEASED

2002-05-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Filters can check for presence of SpamAssassin at run-time
	using the %Features hash; therefore, the suggested filter
	has been merged with the SpamAssassin-enabled filter and
	we distribute only one filter.

	* mimedefang.c: Made default value for "-n" option 10.

	* Merged patches from Michael McLagan for packaging.

2002-05-02  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Improved scripts for Red Hat.  The "mimedefang" init script
	is separated out from "sendmail", and settings are stored in
	/etc/sysconfig/mimedefang.

	* Added redhat/ directory for building RPMs.

	* Moved word-to-html to contrib/ dir; do not install it by
	default.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (message_contains_virus_filescan): Minor cleanups.

	* Updated documentation.

	* mimedefang.c (main): Added '-P' option to write mimedefang's
	process-ID to a file.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: SpamAssassin, Anomy::HTMLCleaner and File::Scan
	are detected at run-time, so if you install or remove those Perl
	modules, you do not need to rerun ./configure and install a new
	version of mimedefang.pl.

2002-05-01  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Use the first found of:
	      /etc/mail/spamassassin/sa-mimedefang.cf
	      /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
	      /etc/mail/spamassassin.cf
	as the SpamAssassin preferences file.

	* Install our SpamAssassin preferences file as:
	      /etc/mail/spamassassin/sa-mimedefang.cf

	* Updated examples/filter-using-spam-assassin.

	* Makefile.in: Added MANDIR and LIBDIR macros; added RPM_INSTALL_ROOT
	in front of install: targets to ease building of RPM's.  Thanks
	to Michael McLagan for suggesting this.

2002-04-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (handleWorkerReceivedAnswer): Distinguish
	between a timeout and the premature death of a worker.

	* Makefile.in (MANIFEST): Added contrib/ directory.

	* mimedefang.c (cleanup): Do not remove spool directories if
	"-k" command-line option given and the filter fails.

	* configure.in: Check for socklen_t at configure time.

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (handlePipe): Removed possibility
	of an extremely unlikely race condition.

2002-04-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (rebuild_entity): Added support for
	filter_multipart to examine the headers of parts with
	sub-parts.

	(interpret_avp_code): Updated intepretation of AVP return
	codes.

2002-04-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.8 RELEASED

2002-04-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Added detection of unpatched MIME-Tools;
	moved virus-scanner status display to the end.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (message_rejected): Made message_rejected
	return true for action_bounce, action_tempfail AND action_discard.

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients:
	Use re_match instead of re_match_ext to mitigate problems with
	malformed MIME.

2002-04-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Added warning about unintended consequences
	of using action_bounce().

	* Added "-p" option to mimedefang-multiplexor to write process-ID
	to a file.

	* If you send mimedefang-multiplexor a SIGINT signal, it
	terminates idle workers and forces busy workers to terminate as
	soon as they become idle.  This is useful for forcing a reread
	of the filter rule file without stopping and restarting
	Sendmail.

2002-04-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.7 RELEASED

2002-04-12  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* README: Updated documentation.

	* mimedefang-filter.5: Clarified documentation on action_rebuild().

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added support for File::Scan, thanks to
	Nels Lindquist.

2002-04-09  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (MXSenderOK): Added calls to filter_sender to
	reject messages from blacklisted senders early.

	* INCOMPATIBILITY: You must now supply the "-r" flag to mimedefang
	if you want filter_relay to be called!  Most sites do not use
	filter_relay, so it's a waste of resources to call it unnecessarily.

2002-04-02  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* configure.in: Added "--with-quarantinedir" configure option.
	This lets you keep quarantined files in a separate directory
	from the spool directory.  You can then keep the main spool
	directory on a RAM disk for better performance.

2002-03-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (message_rejected): Added message_rejected function
	to test if something earlier on has bounced or tempfailed message.

2002-03-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (action_notify_sender): Do nothing if
	$Sender is "<>".  Thanks to Jason Englander.

2002-03-03  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (signal_complete): Do not notify sender if
	sender is '<>'

	* Correct typo in action array to make logging of actions accurate.
	Thanks to Martin Bene.

	* Redirect Sendmail's stdout to /dev/null when sending mail.

2002-02-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.6 RELEASED

2002-02-26  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* examples/suggested-minimum-filter-for-windows-clients: Commented
	out anomy_clean_html so filter works out-of-the-box on all
	systems.

2002-02-25  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (rebuild_entity): Work around bug in MIME::Tools
	which fails to rebuild message of type "message/rfc822"

	* Added support for filter_relay function which lets you
	reject connections early on in the SMTP transaction in multiplex
	mode.  Still works in non-multiplex mode, but not early on in the
	SMTP dialog.

2002-02-22  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (action_tempfail): Added $msg parameter
	which lets you customize the tempfail message.

2002-02-21  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c: Relax test for "suspicious" characters to
	worry only about embedded <CR> and <NUL> characters.

	* Increased SMALLBUF from 256 to 2048 to handle long headers
	better.

2002-02-20  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (body): Added checks for suspicious characters
	in e-mail body.

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added $SuspiciousCharsInBody variable.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_status()): Fixed all the
	spam_assassin functions to work with SpamAssasssin 2.x as well
	as 1.5.

	(time_str): Made generated quarantine directory names use
	dots instead of colons in time -- this makes them more
	Samba-friendly.

	* Deprecated action_rebuild.  It causes problems.

2002-02-19  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.pl.in (rebuild_entity): Reworked logic to avoid
	undefined ->bodyhandle calls.

	* More examples and a README in the examples/ directory.

	* mimedefang.pl.in (spam_assassin_check()): Made it work
	with SpamAssassin 2.0.1.  Thanks to Mark Roedel.

	* (action_add_header): Correctly wrap headers whose values
	contain embedded newlines.

2002-02-18  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Version 2.5 RELEASED

	* mimedefang-multiplexor.c (statsLog): Added "-T" option
	to log statistics using syslog.

2002-02-17  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (safeWriteHeader): Set a flag if suspicious
	characters are found in header; communicate that to mimedefang.pl

	* mimedefang.pl.in: Added action_rebuild and $SuspiciousCharsInHeaders

	* Remove examples/high-risk-filter and examples/low-risk-filter

2002-02-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	Version 2.4 RELEASED

2002-02-15  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* mimedefang.c (safeWriteHeader): Added workaround for MIME-parsing
	bug in Microsoft Outlook.

2002-01-29  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Reworked the internals of event.c and event_tcp.c to handle

2002-01-16  Dianne Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Added action_tempfail to force an SMTP "try again" code.

	codes and suggest courses of action (tempfail, virus, etc.)

	* Added action_quarantine_entire_message()
