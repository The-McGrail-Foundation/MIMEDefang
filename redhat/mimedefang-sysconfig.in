# Description : This is the configuration file for the RedHat RPM
#               init script.  It lives in /etc/sysconfig as mimedefang
#
#               Documents all variables used by the init script and gives
#               recommended values.  For boolean variables, any value other
#               than 'yes' (all lower case) means NO.

# The spool directory
# SPOOLDIR=@SPOOLDIR@

# The socket used by mimedefang to communicate with sendmail
# SOCKET=$SPOOLDIR/mimedefang.sock

# If you want to log messages like "Filter time is 156ms" to syslog,
# uncomment the next line
# LOG_FILTER_TIME=yes

# Run the multiplexor and filters as this user, not root.  RECOMMENDED
MX_USER=defang

# If you want to keep spool directories around if the filter fails,
# set the next one to yes
# KEEP_FAILED_DIRECTORIES=no

# If "yes", turn on the multiplexor relay checking function
# MX_RELAY_CHECK=no

# If "yes", turn on the multiplexor HELO checking function
# MX_HELO_CHECK=no

# If "yes", turn on the multiplexor sender checking function
# MX_SENDER_CHECK=no

# If "yes", turn on the multiplexor recipient checking function
# MX_RECIPIENT_CHECK=no

# Ask for filter_tick to be called every 60 seconds
# MX_TICK_REQUEST=60

# Run three tick bands
# MX_TICK_PARALLEL=3

# Set to yes if you want the milter and multiplexor sockets
# to be group-writable.  This also makes files created by mimedefang
# group-readable.
MD_ALLOW_GROUP_ACCESS=no

# Set to yes if you want the multiplexor to log events to syslog
MX_LOG=yes

# Number of workers reserved for connections from loopback.  Use -1
# for default behaviour, 0 to allow loopback connections to queue,
# or >0 to reserve workers for loopback connections
LOOPBACK_RESERVED_CONNECTIONS=-1

# Set to path name of UNIX-domain socket if you want to use MIMEDefang
# with Sendmail's SOCKETMAP map type

# Set to yes if you want to use an embedded Perl interpreter
# MX_EMBED_PERL=yes

# Set to the syslog facility.  Also set $SyslogFacility in your filter
# SYSLOG_FACILITY=mail

# The multiplexor does not start all workers at the same time.  Instead,
# it starts one worker every MX_WORKER_DELAY seconds when the system is idle.
# (If the system is busy, the multiplexor starts workers as incoming mail
# requires attention.)
# MX_WORKER_DELAY=3

# The next setting is an absolute limit on worker activation.  The multiplexor
# will NEVER activate a worker within MX_MIN_WORKER_DELAY seconds of another.
# The default of zero means that the multiplexor will activate workers as
# quickly as necessary to keep up with incoming mail.
# MX_MIN_WORKER_DELAY=0

# Set to yes if you want the multiplexor to log stats in
# /var/log/mimdefang/md-stats  The /var/log/mimedefang directory
# must exist and be writable by the user you're running MIMEDefang as.

# MX_REQUESTS=200

# Minimum number of processes to keep.  The default of 0 is probably
# too low; we suggest 2 instead.
MX_MINIMUM=2

# If you want to allow the multiplexor to queue new connections when
# all workers are busy, set this to yes
ALLOW_NEW_CONNECTIONS_TO_QUEUE=yes

# Maximum number of processes to run (mail received while this many
# processes are running is rejected with a temporary failure, so be
# wary of how many emails you receive at a time).  This applies only
# if you DO use the multiplexor.  The default value of 2 is probably
# too low; we suggest 10 instead
MX_MAXIMUM=10

# Uncomment to log worker status; it will be logged every
# MX_LOG_WORKER_STATUS_INTERVAL seconds
# MX_LOG_WORKER_STATUS_INTERVAL=30

# Uncomment next line to have busy workers send status updates to the
# multiplexor.  NOTE: Consumes one extra file descriptor per worker, plus
# a bit of CPU time.
# MX_STATUS_UPDATES=yes

# Limit worker processes' resident-set size to this many kilobytes.  Default
# is unlimited.
# MX_MAX_RSS=10000

# Limit total size of worker processes' memory space to this many kilobytes.
# Default is unlimited.
# MX_MAX_AS=30000

# If you want to use the "notification" facility, set the appropriate port.
# See the mimedefang-notify man page for details.
# MX_NOTIFIER=inet:4567

# Number of seconds a process should be idle before checking for
# minimum number and killed
# MX_IDLE=300

# Limit number of concurrent recipok requests on a per-domain basis.
# 0 means no limit
MX_RECIPOK_PERDOMAIN_LIMIT=0

# Number of seconds a process is allowed to scan an email before it is
# considered dead.  The default is 30 seconds; we suggest 600.

# Multiplexor queue timeout -- default is 30 seconds
# MX_QUEUE_TIMEOUT=30

# Any extra arguments to mimedefang
# MD_EXTRA="-a auth_author"

# SUBFILTER specifies which filter rules file to use
# SUBFILTER=@CONFDIR_EVAL@/mimedefang-filter

# I question why I'm including this as I see no real need for it
# but in the interests of a flexible implementation, here goes!
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS VARIABLE LIGHTLY!!
#
# The filtering program used by mimedefang or the multiplexor. This is
# *NOT* a replacement for @CONFDIR_EVAL@/mimedefang-filter!!!  It replaces
# the entire mimedefang perl program, /usr/bin/mimedefang.pl and allows
# a unique filtering agent to be used.  Read mimedefang-protocol man
# page VERY carefully before you attempt to change this!
#
# FILTER=/usr/bin/mimedefang.pl
